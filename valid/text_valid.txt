Water.

That shit runs out.

So we'll be taking yours.

While your planet continues
to dick around with a, uh --

what is their version
of it called?

Lovefinderrz,
with two "R's" and a "Z."

- Oof.
- Yeah, not my idea.

- Goddamn.
- Am I interrupting?

- Impossible. Here she is.
- Mwah.

Your prisoners
are getting away.

Prisoners
are just things.

Connect with me.
Tell me about your day.

I had
an incredible meeting.

Did you know humans
are 80% water?

And I found a new podcast
we can listen to tonight.

Love it.

Okay, back to work.

Find and kill
those earthlings.

We're outnumbered.
There's no hope.

Then we go out
in glory.

Flesh intruder,
prepare to die.

Oh, hold on.

My apologies,
Lieutenant Commander.

No problem.
At ease, Solider.

Initiate Employee
Evaluation Mode.

- Accessing delivery archive.
- Okay, listen.

You delivered an avian
protein club sandwich

with no lettu--
Goddamn it.

Oy, scoping
for this bit, then?

Alright, a-a-alright.
I know you want to have

the big guy/little guy fight, but--

Aw, are you
fucking kidding me?

Here at the Midland Quasar,
where, in a complete upset,

the Robolution has overturned
the lizards.

It's totally unexpected.

Uh, I understand,
Mr. Phillips.

Yes.

I believe
this is yours.

You, uh --
you dropped that.

I'll have to
call you back.

Where do you
want to die?

Susan, is conference room three
available?

Can I look at a photo
of my wife while you kill me?

Sure,
but I'm doing her a favor.

She either has
terrible taste,

or she's trapped in a marriage
to a toilet thief.

She's dead.

And I don't mind
joining her.

Life has been hollow
since I lost her.

Using your toilet
was nice, though.

I'm a bit
of a shy pooper.

I'm ready when you are.

Stay there.

Tell him
what you told me.

What is this?
What's happening?

Tell him
what you told me.

My wife's still alive.

Sh--sh--she went into remission
10 years ago.

And what did you do
today?

Oh, I, uh, pooped

on a really awesome toilet
I found --

oh, ow, ow,
ow, ow, oh!

Don't use your dead wife
as an excuse.

You shit on my toilet because
you don't know your place,

and your place
is nothing.

So next time you stumble
onto a toilet

that feels too good
for your ass, trust me, it is.

You're not gonna
kill me?

Don't tell me
what to do!

♪ She say, "This is my shit,
my shit"♪

♪ See the flick of my wrist,
of my wrist♪

♪ And I know
she know what's up♪

♪ Baby, this is my shit,
my shit♪

♪ See the flick of my wrist,
my wrist♪

Are you fucking kidding me?

♪ When you in my section,
fill it up when my cup empty♪

♪ I can't fuck with rats♪

♪ That's a fact,
that's a dub nigga ♪

Oh, so you like being alive?

So why the fuck
are you back here?

After you left,
I thought about what you said

and how much
I needed to hear it,

but then I thought about
whyyou were saying it,

who you were really
saying it to.

You need the same thing
I needed, Rick.

You need someone to give you,
permission to live.

What the...?

I thought
you were a shy pooper.

You know what
shy pooping is, Rick?

It's a pointless bid
for control.

You want to take
the one part of life

that you truly think is yours,
and you want to protect it

from a universe
that takes whatever it wants.

It took my wife.

It clearly took something
from you.

We can spend our lives
fighting that,

or we can choose
to be free.

You're right, Tony.
I'm done fighting.

Time to be free.

Oh, wait,
you're actually gonna --

Oh, God!
Oh, God!

Where am I?
- Hi, little mouse.

Baby bee?
I missed you so much.

I never really left you.

Then you know
that a few years ago

I started getting into --
- Strap-on porn?

Yes.
I thought it was hot.

Now, come on.
- Where are you going?

- To poop.
- Where?

Wherever you want,
forever.

My God.

You rang?
I'm pooping, too.

Come, Tony.
Come on.

Come poop with me.
Poop with me, Tony.

Poop with me.

What are you waiting for?

Aren't you gonna join us,
Tony?

Aren't you gonna join us
in the pooping?

Where are we?
What is this?

That's it.
Get out.

You can make
a perfectly-realized,

toilet-filled simulation
of heaven,

but you can't share
a toilet?

Don't insult my craft.

The chemical
is Globaflyn.

It connects the
whatever-you-want section

of your brain to the
whatever-you-have section.

If your heaven is toilets,
that's on you.

All of these people...

Are living their wildest,
meaningless dreams

and leaving me
out of them.

People you refuse to kill and
refuse to let into your life.

An offer you rejected,
so here's your last chance.

Goodbye forever. If you touch
my toilet again, you die.

You need a friend.

I have a million
cooler friends than you.

- I'll be seeing you.
- You'll be dying.

- We're gonna be friends.
- You're gonna be dead.

So, we fight our way
to the gas line,

we cut it,
and then we set a fire.

Okay. Alright.

Morty, "Adventures of Jerry
and Morty," huh?

Put her there.
- Dad, look, y-you know,

w-we don't need
to high-five.

It's --
it's kind of your fault

that we're in this situation
at all.

I know, but,
you know, come on.

"Adventures of Jerry
and Morty."

Okay.

Mwah.

Jeff, I can explain
everything.

You don't have to.

Can you just marry us
instead?

Jeff, don't do it!

Richard.

Maggie.

- Running Bird.
- Let's get out of here.

- Priest Witherspoon.
- Josiah?

Let's get the fuck
out of here.

Summer Smith, let's get
the hell out of here.

You had me
at my own name.

Oh, yeah, no.
Why would I...?

Summer!

Fucking thing.

Come on. I can't steer this.

What in the hell
are you doing?

- Parenting.
- That's not how I did it.

Yeah,
where's yourdaughter?

Ah, you're right.

She joined ISIS.

It's Glootie, and he's had
a change of heart.

And he's going to
set us free.

Actually, he's been blamed
for bringing you aboard

and assigned
to execute you.

Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Okay.

What would your girlfriend
think of you murdering?

I happen to be between
relationships right now.

Really? I thought your species
had perfected relationships.

Here.We're not allowed
to use those apps.

I wonder why.

Yeah, that's what I thought,
Glootie.

Looks like you and I...

...are all we've got.

I'm not helping you
any more than that,

but if you can find
the hangar,

grab a ship
and get the hell out of here.

Where you going,
Glootie?

I've got a date
with dumping a dating app.

Glootie-ootie-ooh!

- Was that ever his thing?
- No.

- He never exited that way.
- No, first time.

Dad,
I want to say something.

I started today disgusted
and embarrassed to be your son,

and then later I thought
we were gonna die

because you're a loser.

- There's no more, is there?
- Nope.

Now quit fucking up,
and let's go.

Is Tony here? I br--
I brought him some, uh,

Vegan Fiber Chili,
delicious family recipe,

and a box of these, uh,
chocolates, sugar free.

He can eat as many of these
as he wants.

Anyways, uh, just wanted
to drop these off,

and you tell him, uh,
the toilet's all his.

H-He -- he'll know
what I mean.

Tony died.

- Excuse me?
- He quit his job,

starting living life
to the fullest.

He crashed into a tree

space-skiing
down Mount Space Everest.

Fuck.

There's
a Mount Space Everest?

Okay.
Uh, Jesus.

I-I got to process this.

Oh, no, no. You --
you don't want to eat that.

Y-y-you'll -- you'll --
you'll become

the opening
of "The Beverly Hillbillies."

You know what I'm saying?
A little bubbling crude?

Texas tea?
- I don't know these references.

Yeah, but you have
a Space Everest?

Watch
"Space Beverly Hillbilllies"

so my jokes can land,
you fucking twat.

Now what?

Happily ever after.

And after that?

We'll find out
together.

Summer, how many soul mates
is that in the last week?

Four. You can't stop me
from loving who I love, Mom.

Oh, the shit I can't.

I'm gonna mother you
until your 18th birthday,

even if I get thrown in prison
for non-consensual mothering.

And even then,
I will break out,

come to your house,
kick down your door,

and mother your fucking face
out of your stupid asshole.

I'm gonna daughter
your brains out, bitch.

Motherfucker!

That's my name.
Don't wear it out.

Gimme dat new soul mate.

Ad wall?

Fuck this.

Ad wall?What, they want us
to pay for it now?

Ugh, ad wall?

Come on, Mom.
Let's go home.

Great.
We lost Earth.

We aren't defined by what we do,
and we only need each other.

Each other --
and water.

There's no water?

Honey, the whole point
of conquering Earth --

I know the point
of conquering Earth.

Don't talk to me like --
- Like I'm thirsty?

Like I'm your mother,
you childish prick.

How much water
are you sucking

through these stupid
fucking tubes on your back?

These tubes are cool,
and I want a divorce.

or should we dress
you like a terrorist?

I don't need to be here,
and I'm still the President.

Oh, glad to hear it. That means
you can give me that pardon.

Or -- Or I could put
you out with the trash.

What is your problem?!
Why do you hate this country?

I hate every country
in the universe, brother!

They're job placement programs

for the politicians
that invent them --

Okay, Fight Club.

I get paid to protect
the sidelines you sit on!

You get paid to make
sports metaphors!

I clean your litterbox!

So your little nerd
paws don't have to touch

another nerd's nerdy
poopies while you're flexing

your grody little edge
lord anus all over it!

Guys, maybe you're
both right and both wrong.

Shut up, Morty!

You little bitch, you
destroyed the Constitution.

You're the biggest
booger eater here!

Do not talk to my son that way.

Sorry, Mrs. Smith.

The two of you are
ruining Thanksgiving.

Together.

And you can both
either come to the table

and eat food with my family

or you can keep doing what
you're doing at the corner bar.

Bars actually suck
at Thanksgiving.

sort through this.

had the personal quality

want actual vital organs?

This Charlie Kaufman
reboot of "Wizard of Oz"

is destroying itself.

job writing this!

Pass the potatoes.

Thank you. Mm-hmm.

Good green beans, Mom.

The turkey's raw,
Dad. Shit's potato bunz.

Sorry, Summer, the
United States enclosed us

in a shimmer bubble that
scrambled my oven timer.

So I guess elections
do have consequences.

Eat my ass, Jerry. I've
seen your IRS records.

You can blame me once
you have taxable income.

Yes, Jerry is a piece of shit.

I agree.

Um, guys? What's that?

President Curtis has enacted

turkeys in America

approval from Congress

pay raise in six hours.

My God, the bastard's unhinged!

There won't be a
single bird left in DC!

Oh, wow, wiping out a native
population on Thanksgiving?

- That's never happened before.
- What did you just say?

Well, I-I associated
Thanksgiving with genocide.

It's what young people
do. I wasn't trying to --

The Crypt of the New World.

That could be our one
chance to turn this thing around.

You know about the Crypt?

Ugh, so the treasure's
already gone.

Wait, is that why you were
stealing the Constitution?

You old fart dick.

The Crypt of the New
World isn't a treasure.

But it might be our
only hope. Come on.

But isn't the crypt
underneath DC?

The Turkey
President's got an army.

An actual Army.
And an Air Force.

And Marines --Slow down, Morty.

Walk us through
every military service.

Does somebody have a pen?

We've got something
more powerful

than every army in the world.

Well, no, we don't, but
with the right speech,

we could get a handful
of well-trained hillbillies.

Eh, it worked against
the British. I'm in.

Birds replacin' people.

What would Johnny Cash
or Dale Earnhardt say?

He'd say "It's time
to walk the line"

or "Drive very fast
between two of them."

We don't serve your kind here.

Oh, my God, are you serious?

Read the sign.

He's my boss, Marvin.

It's okay.

Mistrusting Presidents
is a patriotic duty.

And that guy on TV isn't me.

He's a turkey
infused with my DNA.

I'll be damned.

Well, I'm racist.

You better not be here
to take my man again.

- Mary Lou.
- I'm poor!

And pregnant!

With a poor person!

And I need you.

And 10% of your baby.

Now, look, I know it's gonna
take more than some speech.

But what is a speech?

Isn't it just a question?

And isn't that a question too?

Speeches are words.

Repeated words.

Listed words.

Repeated lists of
repeated words.

None of that matters.

You know what does matter?

Me. Asking you.

"Will you do what I say?"

Just two questions, Chief.

Lock? And load?

They're rhetorical, sir!

Lock and load!

Sir, we've got Rick and Morty
coming in what appears to be

an unlicensed "Star Wars" AT-AT.

Or as the millennials
say, A-T, A-T.

So it begins.

Gobblers!

Tonight, we rise!

Aww, geez, geez, geez.

Nice driving, Sanchez.

Wire's down, pen is clear.

You know the Goddamn rules!

If you see something
clucking or pecking,

put a buckshot in its panties.

Jesus Christ!
T-they got Johnson!

He got off easy.

Hold off the bastards!

What now, Rick?

Time to turn up the broiler.

Whoa, i-is that --

The Crypt of the New World.

The treasure you were after
is this country's oldest secret.

One disguised by centuries
of Thanksgiving folklore.

Is that... a turkey dinosaur?

America's original rulers.

Merciless beasts, grazing on
the flesh of cowering humans.

Then, in the 15th
century, a vessel crashed.

Two vessels, really.

On board -- our saviors.

Sanchez, pull that lever
at the same time I do.

Oh, shit, they're gonna fight!

No, wait, they love each other!

They were at war
when they arrived,

but they united over
their hatred of turkeys.

And what they love even
more than each other

is kicking turkey butt.

Gentlemen!

Coooooooooorn!

It's working!

Come on, Sanchez, let's
power down the humanizer ray.

Whose side are we on?

I don't know, but we've done
enough to pay for college.

Look, we're almost there.

Sorry, my turn for a surprise.

Damn, this guy loves
arriving from the shadows.

Look around. You can't
beat our ancient warriors.

Can't I? My kind has
always dealt with predators.

That's why we sleep in trees.

And that's why,
in the wild, we fly.

Now you must choose ---

Fight me, or stop that
weapon from turning

all of America's turkeys
into a new master race.

You dumb dip shit,
there's three of us,

and two of us are spacemen.

Obviously they're
gonna save America

and bring that monument home,

and I'm gonna kick your ass.

Oh, and, Sanchez?

You got your pardon. Aw.

Shut up, Morty. Come on.

Let's go, bitch.

So be it.

Is it true what Turkey Man said?

That turkeys sleep in trees?

Who the hell cares, Morty?

Let's just deactivate this shit.

Oh, my God, they
gave it a voice?

Who is this for? We're in space.

Geez, Rick, I-I-I guess them?

Morty, use this carefully.

Crack the humanizer
core and cut the blue wire.

You hear me? Blue wire.

Wha-- Why don't
we just blow it up?

It's a national
monument, fuck nut!

We just got pardoned.

You really wanna do
this again next year?

You forgot something,
Turkey Man.

No matter what you
got people to believe,

I'm still the Goddamn President.

And you forget, in the
one day I've had your job,

I've learned 10 times as much.

I've underestimated you.

For the last time.

Rick, they're not
exactly primary colors!

A-Are -- Are we cool
with, like, t-turquoise?

Are you kidding me, Morty?
Just cut the damn thing!

Oh, shit, oh, fuck --

- Activating weapon.

Oh, shit! Oooooooh!

Morty!

God damn it, you had one job!

I beat you.

Look at me, you
turkey ass bitch.

Wait, why are you --

Is that a wishbone?

I wish to explode.

Man ♪ It's called
the Playstation.

- "Shakespeare in Love."

- Hurricane Katrina

- Playstation 3.

- Playstation 4.

- I want a Playstation 5.

I wasn't sure when
to pull you out.

I-I assumed you were
running through your whole life.

Yes.

And what a life it was.

Gentlemen, thank you once
again for saving this nation.

I don't speak googa.

The CIA only taught me
your activation phrase.

But if I could say anything...

I'd say give America
one more chance.

Oh, my God, they're gonna
fight. Th-They're really gonna fight.

- Aw, they love each other!
- Never gets old.

I'll never get tired of that.

So... after those aliens
discovered America...

They went into hibernation,

leaving us the technology
we used to lead the free world.

That and also to
do stuff like slavery.

I always thought we were...
more special than that.

Like we invented
everything and did everything

and that's why
we own everything.

Now I- I- I- I don't
know what to feel.

Feel thankful, Morty.

Feel thankful.




I know, baby.

Coop, honey, should we get
Lucky Charms or Kibble Bibbitz?

You know we can't afford either.

Baby, the President
owes you. You saved him.

Ain't his fault our
insurance got cut.

They gotta build missiles.

Ugh, fine, just -- Can y'all
hold Jakey for a second?

What the hell's he doin?

I think he's foraging.

Crazy bastard
thinks he's a turkey.

Well, I refuse to pay for
this man's health care.

Did you get any of that?
﻿

Chicks are gonna
be up all up in our biz

when they see us wearing
these Rick and Morty custom tees.

I bet we could sell these.

Hells yeah. I
fuckin' love merch!

Aah!

- The rain! It -- It burns!
- Oh, shit.

Quick, Morty,
protect the shirts!

The door! Open the door!

Rick! Is it --

Morty, will ya stop tryna--

Okay, there, it's open.

- Jesus.
- My skin is on fire.

W-Why is the rain doing that?

My acid rain will destroy

all things green and natural or
my name isn't Diesel Weasel.

Huh. Well, that
guy's easy to please.

Your acid rain
is an acid pain...

in the butt, Diesel Weasel!

Yikes. Wow.

Who's the chick in
need of a dialogue pass?

First order of business is
to clean up this acid rain

with a little wind!

Yoww!

Ow! Ow, my leg!

Wow.

And now an elemental
punch that's too hot to handle!

Wa-kah!

Oh, wow.

Curse you, Planetina!

I'll get you next slime!

There's only one solution
for Earth's pollution -- you!

- Wow.
- Morty, if you say "wow"

one more time, I
swear to fucking God...

Are you crazy, Rick?
She's right there!

Yeah, get that aluminum,
Morty. It's 8% of the Earth.

We'll need every atom.

Thanks! Every litter-bit helps!

Your problem!

Excuse me? S-Sorry.

I-I-I wanted to say, "N-No
problem, you're welcome,"

a-a-and it came
out "your problem."

I-I'm an idiot. Sorry.

You're not an
idiot. You recycled.

- I-I'm Morty.
- Nice to meet you, Morty.

I'm Planetina, and I hope
you have a wonderful day.

Hey!

The fuck we doin' here?

Uhh, y-y-you like soft serve?

There's a shop around the bend.

Oh, I don't eat ice cream.

Veal is a product
of the dairy industry.

Oh, that's not good.

No, it is not.

Oh, my God! Come on! Let's go!

I know a place that serves
cruelty-free doughnuts.

If you'd like, I could fly
you and your friend there

easy-peasy, lemon-squeezy.

Okay, I-I-I'll ask him.

He -- He said he
can't come. Let's go!

What the fuck was that shit?

The Earth is in danger!

Pollution and waste
are ruining our planet.

Mother Nature has enlisted
the help of four young adults

from each major ethnicity
-- and when things look bad,

and I mean really bad --
they combine the powers

of their elemental
rings to create me!

Planetina, conservationist
super person!

There's only one solution...

P-Pretty cool, huh?

I-I can't believe I actually
hung out with Planetina.

How old is this woman?
She looks very mature.

She's a sentient amalgam
of natural elements,

so I don't believe
age applies to her.

Great. Taylor Murphy
dumps me the day before his

hella-big pool party
and my little brother's

dating a phase four super hero.

Just shoot me in the
fucking head until I die.

Hey, hey, none of
that, Summerfest.

Look what you're doing to
your sister, you piece of shit.

Is it weird that she
hasn't texted me yet?

- Yes.
- No.

What if I told you that
your Grandpa Rick's

got something up his
sleeve that's so Rick-diculous

that it's gonna make
you forget all about

that stupid asshole
that dumped you?

Hey, my egg plate!

Morglutz, Slartivart,
and Ferkus 9 --

three planets are all ending
in a delayed succession

of cataclysmic events.

A jam like this comes
around only once in a lifetime.

Morglutz's sun is
going supernova,

Slartivart is falling
into a black hole,

and Ferkus 9 is getting
"Deep Impact" -ed

by an asteroid.

They're all having a
major, final blow out --

and I'm gonna drug it up
and suck it up before each one

goes ka-blamo, and I'm taking

my favorite grandkid
along with me!

Hells yeah.10
seconds on Morglutz,

and you'll be up to your
neck in I-could-give-two-

shits-about-what's-his-ass.

And also herpes.

Um... Oh, my God,

thank you, Grandpa Rick!

I'm gonna go pack my rollie.

Um, Summer? I-I-I haven't
given you my approval yet.

Summer, approval

is yet to be given here!

There's a huge forest fire

like 200 miles from here!

This is amazing!
Planetina's bound to be there.

Mom, I-I need the credit
card to buy a train ticket.

Absolutely not.

Mom, this is the biggest
wildfire of the year!

- You're not going!
- You're not going!

Da fuck I'm not.

Last time I checked,
this wasn't Russia.

- It's not Russia, Jerry.
- My heart is broken,

and I deserve to let loose,

and if you don't like it,
you can suck my bigger tit.

Adios, C-words.

Morty, I don't want
you getting hurt.

- Please, think this over.
- I don't want to think!

I want to see a girl I like.

If you don't want to help me,

I'll find my own goddamn
way to the wildfire.

- I'll get the wine.
- Thank you.

The Governor has implemented
a mandatory evacuation.

Abandon all hope, people!
Nothing will stop this fire.

Nothing!

Scratch that! Here's
Planetina, Savioress of Earth!

Yeeouch! Talk about a hot foot.

Better put this wildfire on ice!

Come here, little buddy.

Come on, come on,
come on, I gotcha.

Morty?! What are you doing here?

Oh, hey! Y-You're here, too?

Yeah, I heard about
the wildfire back home,

and, you know, I
stopped by to lend a hand.

H-Here you go,
fella. All safe now.

Ahh, rabbits --
al-always hopping --

Never stoppin'.

Y-Yeah.

S-So it was, uh,
great hanging --

hanging out the other day.

I-I was getting kind of
a -- I mean I-I got kind of

a p-positive vibe.

Oh, good. I was putting one out.

I-I really like you.

Holy shit.

I-I-I mean, uh,
well, oh, all right.

Next step, you
w-want to go out again?

I do! But, uh,
Morty, I have kids.

Oh, I-I-I'll get along
with them. I'm-I'm a kid.

No, I mean the four kids
that bring me into existence

by combining the power
of their elemental rings

so I can save Earth
from ecological disasters.
and, yeah, you shouldn't.

But I hope you know
that's not what

that session was supposed to be.

Oh, no, I mean, I know
it was Morty peeing his pants

and Summer snorting glue
or whatever...

[BETH LAUGHS]

She huffed enamel, and we never
even talked about it.

RICK: Well, there was
so much more at stake.

[BETH LAUGHS]

RICK: I mean, that shrink,
what a monologuist.

Are we gonna go back?

Sweetie, could I get --
get that syringe now?

Oh, my God, yes!
Dad, it's in my purse.

Oh, I'm sorry.
You must be in agony.

Eh.

[GROANS]

[COUGHING]

Jesus.

[COUGHS]

Jesus Christ.
Therapists, man.

Weird breed.

Man, I missed having hands...

and blood and a stomach.

We should get a drink.

Really?
Like, go somewhere?

Yeah, let's drop the kids off
and go tie one on.

Absolutely.

L-I liked her.

So what are you thinking,
like, Smokey's Tavern?

Maybe Shoney's?

Yeah,either one.
Either one.

[DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYS]

RICK: You'll never get away
with this, Concerto.

That is where you're mistaken,
Mr. Sanchez.

This shall be my greatest
performance of all time!

["MOONLIGHT SONATA" PLAYS]

RICK: This is it, Morty.
We're goners.

We're not getting
out of this one.

After everything
we've been through,

this is how we're gonna die.

Make peace with your god.

Oh, geez, Rick,
I-I-I don't want to die!

And now for the E-splat!

[GRUNTS]

Jaguar!

Who -- Who was that, Rick?

That, Morty, is why
you don't go to therapy.

﻿

Ugh, leave me,
Morty. It's the only way.

Wha-- Were -- Wha-- Were we --

Were we Blades in that one?

That's fucking tight.

Just stay with me.

I'm -- I'm scared, Morty.

I can see the end.

I'm a silly man.

I'm a silly small man.

I'm -- I'm sorry I
got you into this.

Then how about I
get us outta this?

Hello? Hey, Jessica.

Oh, hey, Morty. What's up?

Um, I just want to say
that you're really great.

I know the timing never
really worked out with us,

but you're really great and I
wish I got to know you better.

Oh, I mean -- That's a lot.

Oh, uh, yeah,
sorry, I guess I just --

No, I just wish
you said it sooner.

- Wh-What?
- Yeah, I mean, being nervous

is sort of selfish
sometimes, y'know?

- - Yeah, that's a great point.

Well, what are
you doing tonight?

Do you, like, want to watch
a movie or something?

Um, yeah. Tonight. Sounds great.

Holy shit. Holy shit.

Come on, come on!

Oh.

- Where are we?
- We're home, Rick.

I-I landed us in the ocean.

The ocean?! The ocean on Earth?!

- Uh, yeah, I-I guess so.
- Oh, shit.

Holy shit. We have to go.

We have to go right fucking now.

- What?
- You touched the ocean, Morty.

What's the big --
-Oh, fuck. Shit.

What? Shit.

Richard!

You have desecrated
the sacred treaty

betwixt land and sea.

Now face the wrath of
your once and eternal foe --

Mr. Nimbus!

Sorry. Who is that?

My nemesis.

- What?
- My fucking nemesis, okay?

Okay, but what
was his name again?

I am Mr. Nimbus!

He's gonna say that a lot.

W-Wait, so who is
coming over again?

- He said his nemesis?
- Rick has a nemesis?

- I guess.
- Has hementioned him before?

I-I was gonna ask
you. First I'm hearing it.

Who is he? Like a magic guy?

Rick's science and he's magic?

He's like a-a fish?

- A fish.
- He's not a fish. He's Mr. Nimbus.

He's king of the ocean
and he's a piece of shit.

Are you happy, Morty?

Are you happy you
touched the ocean?

He's gonna be here any minute.

Just help me smooth this over

or this guy's gonna become
more trouble than he's worth.

Um, hey, I don't know how
much I can help out tonight, Rick.

Jessica's coming
over j-just to, like,

watch a movie or something,

but y'know,
t-t-that's a good step.

That's a solid step
to something, y'know?

Truly nobody cares
about your dick, Morty.

The sooner you
learn that, the better.

I think you just
don't want me happy

'cause then I'll stop
doing your crazy chores.

Trust me, after
that ocean fuck-up,

you don't get to
do anything crazy.

While I bullshit my way

through this peace
summit treaty with Nimbus,

Summer is gonna dive
into the Marianas Trench

to recover the forbidden shell

that gives him his power

because Summer can be trusted.

Let's lick tits.

- Okay, what?
- I don't love that.

Of course you don't,

'cause you guys
aren't getting any.

Actually, your father and I

have been very
sex-positive lately.

- Eww.
- Dr. Wong suggested we experiment.

We've been watching
pornography. Together.

- Gross!
- I might never come back from the ocean.

Oh, you'll have to
tone it down, babe.

The squares can't handle it.

There are suicide
capsules in all of your teeth.

Do what you want with that.

C'mon, Morty.
You're on booze duty.

Okay, Nimbus only
drinks the good shit.

So just toss this whale-ass
ocean-wine in here

and age it up a few centuries.

So time moves faster in there?

I-I-Is it like a Narnia thing?

I'm not a beaver who
believes in Jesus Christ, Morty.

But yeah, it's pretty
much a Narnia thing.

Okay, but Jessica --All you
have to do is bring wine, Morty.

When do I ask you -for anything?
- When do you --

I haven't been to a full
week of school in years!

I don't know shit! And for what?

How many enemies
do you have to have?

Why is everything
a fight with you?

You might want to
learn this early, Morty.

- Life is a fight.
- With Mr. Nimbus?

Are you makin' fun of me?

Mr. Nimbus is an
ice-cold dick killer, Morty.

Okay, let's go. That's
his magic ocean horn.

Is that Mr. Nimbus?

Nimbus. Richard.

You look like ass.

Let's get this over with.

I'm sorry. This is the guy?

Jerry. Hold on. No.

I've seen you fuck a planet,

and this is the guy
you're afraid of?

I like this one, Rick.

He is unbroken. Untamed.

Perhaps he could use a
firmer grip upon his leash.

Okay, that's enough.
I'm calling the police.

- Go ahead.
- Jerry.

I will! Good.

I control them. Excuse me?

He controls police, Jerry.

Right, that tracks.

In Dumb World. Police?

A strange horny ocean
man is on my lawn.

Well, I don't see
how that's relevant,

but we're white.

- Freeze! Freeze!
- Freeze! Freeze!

Fight.

Fuck.

Flee. Let's get outta here.

- Shall we, Richard?
- Okay, but how did he --

Jesus Christ, Jerry. He's
Mr. Nimbus. He controls the police!

Um, hello? Am I
in the right place?

I just saw a bunch of cops
having sex with each other?

Hi! Jessica! Hi!

Yeah, yup, y-you're
in the right spot.

Uh, everyone,
th-this is Jessica.

This is everybody.
Uh, this is --

I am Mr. Nimbus.

Jesus, Nimbus, just get inside.

Morty, grab the wine.

Yeah, in a minute.
C-C'mon, Jessica.

Stand aside.

Unless you are worthy of Nimbus.

If that means what
I think it means,

I'll have you know, we
watch porn together.

Oh!

Ooh!

Wow, okay! Looks like
you guys just got the nod.

The nod?

Mr. Nimbus has a
sense for these things.

I take it you're a
sex-positive couple?

Oh, yeah. Very much so.

- We watch porn together.
- Great!

I'll mark you down as
eligible for a threeway.

Here's all the
information you'll need.

The king of the ocean wants
to have a threesome with us?

Totally optional.

But a remarkable option to
have, I assure you. Very jealous.

There's a form on the last page

so we know where
to send the gift basket.

So that just happened.

You don't sound upset about it.

Neither do you.

Oh, my God. Is this
happening? To us?

I thought this only happened
in New York or on HBO.

Dr. Wong hasn't been wrong yet.

You're right.

This is exactly what
she was talking about.

So, uh, yeah. J-Just
make yourself comfortable.

Y'know, ch-choose a
movie or -- or we can watch

some interdimensional
cable if you want.

are you doing to me?

Or we can watch
whatever, y'know.

Wh-Whatever you're into.

Morty, did I hear
you're getting wine?

Yeah, I gotta get some
wine for Mr. Nimbus.

Got any extra?

Oh. Uh, yeah.

Yeah, yeah, I'll go
get some, just for you.

Cool. Hurry back.

Looks like you could use a hand.

Oh, hey! Yeah,
th-th-that'd be great.

No problem. Hoovy?
Dinner's ready!

Be right there, sugar hoof!

Just helping this young
man through a portal

with that crate full of alcohol

that's been here for decades.

Hey, thanks, Hoovy.
I-I really appreciate that.

I-I got a girl over, and
I really, really like her.

- I-I'm just nervous.
- Oh, I know that feeling.

When I first started
seeing Bova,

I could only think about all the
ways I was gonna mess it up.

- So what'd you do?
- Oh, I messed it up.

But I found the one
who loves me for that.

Thanks. I-I really
needed to hear that.

Here, -t-take one of these.
- Oh, you don't have to.

No, I-I want to. You
have a good day, Hoovy.

You have a great time
with that lady up there.

Just relax. Will do!

Bova?

Why did you leave us, Father?

Japheth? When were you born?

I swore to Mother
if I ever met you,

I'd avenge her.

It wasn't my fault.

Whose, then? Whose?!

The boy from the magic door.

Shall we discuss terms?

Yeah, fine. Whatever. Terms.

Term number one -- I
am King of the Ocean.

The place I shit? Go ahead.

Term number two --
Stop shitting in the ocean.

No idea what
you're talking about.

Delicious. Another.

Oh, uh, well, I-I was
thinking of using this one for --

Morty, just give him
the bottle. God damn.

Another!

Morty, you get the wine?

Hey, Jessica. Um, yeah, sorry.

I just -- just going
back to get it.

Oh. I thought you already went.

I did! I just -- just
got a little busy.

Going right now, again!

You go ahead and
fire up that movie!

That's okay. I'll wait for you.

Holy shit, holy shit,
holy shit, holy shit!

I've been waiting for you.

Oh, wow. Hoovy, right?

Never say his name!

Jesus Christ!

Why -- Why is every
old guy super jacked?

Sorry! I'm sorry!

I-I just need the
wine! I'm sorry! Stop it!

Fucking kill you!

Ow! Okay, screw this!

You know what?

You! Yeah, fuck you, Hoovy!

Father?

It's him! - I told you he'd come back!
- Holy shit.

Okay, look, he wasn't
old like 10 seconds ago.

Ow! Mother fucker!

I'm sorry, Father. I'm
sorry we never believed.

He'll come back.

Stop him.

Papa, why do we guard the gate?

Because one day, the
dark child shall return.

And we will be ready.

Delicious.

Where is your wine
boy, Richard? I thirst.

He's getting it. Stop
eating beignets like that.

Participant voids all liability

in the event of death by orgasm?

Are we really ready to
open things this wide?

What if it gets weird?

What if I fall in love with him?

No, no, no, no, no. Damn it!

What was that?

Another scheme
of yours, Richard?

I know you're
planning something.

It's nothing. Will you
excuse me, please?

What the fuck is going
on? Where's the wine?

Dad was horny and I dropped it.

God, I can't -- I can't
believe you're fucking this up.

I'm not fucking it up! There
was a guy in the thing and --

There's always a guy in a thing!

Land dwellers do not keep
Nimbus waiting and live.

Be right out! Goddammit.

Do you see this whisper
kitchen "Frasier" bullshit

you're making me do?
Morty, just get the wine.

Beth and Jerry, stop
trying to fuck Nimbus.

Well, -we wouldn't do it here.
- I'll have you know he propositioned us.

He propositions everybody!

Hey, hey, hey, Jessica.

- W-What's up?
- Seems like you're busy.

No, no, no! I ran
into a little trouble.

But -- But -- But I'll go
get that wine right now.

But you said were going
to get it like twice already.

I-I-I was and I-I'm
getting it right now.

Holy shit, it's him!

God damn it! What do
you want me to say?!

I-I'm sorry!

We finally beat him.

But let's always remain vigilant

because you never know.

He might be back one day.

Okay, Narnia! Let's go.

Let's fucking go!

It is over. The boy
is not coming back.

He always comes back.

You have wasted our lives,

our very futures, on a fantasy!

A lie! I know what I saw.

You saw nothing!

You are a foolish boy!

Those called fools

are the only ones brave
enough to see the truth.

Tell me, Father.

Am I a fool now?

I was born in the pits
that made these stones.

I lost my years building
a temple to a lie.

So I made lies my power.

And what is power
but a lie we --

Aah!

Oh, shit, he's real!

He's real! I was wrong!

I was so wrong! God is real!

Wow. Impeccable service.

Big tip. I liked your
other one more.

What was his name? Kyle?

What? Nothing.

Can we just sign
this thing and go?

Jessica, -I-I'm so sorry.
- I mean, it's fine.

You were only gone
like a couple minutes.

Morty, are you okay?

I'm -- I'm sorry, Jessica.

We just never seem
to get it right, do we?

No, I guess we don't.

But I'm glad you called me.

Maybe we can start
over, get it right this time.

Yeah. I'd -- I'd like that.

Thanks for bringing the wine.

Totally worth it.

Do we need an opener?

Oh. I'll -- I'll
-- I'll go get it.

Mmm.

I do so love to sign
upon the dotted line.

Shall we? Jesus Christ, yes.

And who is your witness?

My witness is the squid.

Really proud of this
SeaWorld theme, aren't you?

Hey, just get a witness, man.
Don't make this about me.

Or perhaps Richard has no one

with whom he can trust his life.

Who truly knows him.

Save me. Fine!

I'll get someone. Oh, my God.

Morty! C'mere. I need
you for some bullshit.

Look, Rick, I've done
everything you've asked.

Now can I just have some
time with my girlfriend?

Your girlfriend?

I mean, she's not -- we kissed,

but I'm just trying
to take it slow.

You gotta give these things
time to breathe, y'know?

Do you know why
you're special, Adam?

Because I am -The Traveler?
- Yes.

You will be the one to
pass through the door.

You will be the
one to end our pain.

But, Mother, what about my pain?

There's joyful
and there's joyless,

and we've had our fill
of one.

Morty, make that sweaty writer
stop working

while I kill off
his character.

I have never been more driven
to destroy someone.

Yeah, well, I'm driven
to lower my blood sugar

but guess who's getting tacos
after he kicks your ass?

So you're jacked.
Who cares?

Cum gutters.

I don't like that phrase.
I don't take notes.

You can't beat me, Rick.

I have one million times
your motivation!

So do those guys with the
cellphone kiosks at the mall.

The hair is wrong.

Like you'd be picky
about licensing.

Actually, I would.
I happen to believe that --

You can do that?

You got to want it.

Come on, just stop.
I-I don't want to fight you.

Kid, I'm a writer that wrote
something successful.

So if you want me
to give it up,

you're gonna need a black belt
or a big pair of tits.

Yeah, well,
I don't have those.

In the mythical sense,
I have both.

Joseph Campbell?

Yeah, nice try.
He died in the '80s.

Only you can see and hear me,
Morty.

Just repeat
what I tell you.

Okay.

Sir, you're only proud of
your creation's success

because you want
to be creative,

but creation doesn't happen
through gimmicks,

technology, and distribution.

It doesn't even happen
through work.

Creativity is frankly adjacent
to mental illness and overlaps

with it substantially.

A lot of talented people
kill themselves

and all of them
are miserable.

The real gift
is to be ungifted,

and from what I saw
in your Green Arrow spec script,

that's the gift
you were given.

You couldn't
have seen that.

I'm Joseph Campbell.
I saw it.

The villain
was a placeholder.

I said I saw it, Jan.

I didn't say
I could get past page five.

Y-Your villains
aren't the problem.

The problem is, when you write,
you're a villain.

If you want to be a hero,
just stop.

You know what?
Maybe I will register.

Say it! Tell me
I'm the new Mr. Nimbus!

Oh, looks like your writer
took a hiatus.

Oh, fuck.

You're less motivated
to fight now,

so this is literally punching
down, but you've got it coming.

Please, let me live.

I promise to be cooler.

I'll be less inside baseball.
Maybe I change my name?

Ow!

You failed me.

No, I failed you.

All good things
must come to an end-

All bad things too, though,
so don't flatter yourself.

Jan, Joseph Campbell says

you have to be the one
to put him down.

Wait, wait, wait,
Joseph Campbell also says

you have to use this brand-new
limited edition Rick plush,

available only on
rick-plush.biz.

Supplies are limited.
Act now.

He did?

Shhh.

Jesus, that's the last time
I buy a toy from a Rick.

Ooh, the plushies
are obviously well made.

Thanks for getting us
back alive, Rick.

Well, I am a master
of both worlds, Morty.

Joseph Campbell told me
to stop writing.

Because it should be effortless.

And when it happens organically,
that's when it's meant to be.

You know, like, um, like me.

I'm a writer, here's a pencil.
Writers use pencils.

Okay, so, like, what if, like,
a pencil used me?

Like, um --okay!
Yeah!

Okay, so it's like
a magic pencil

that writes
the writer's life --

holy shit, it's a movie
about a writer!

I am back!

Yeah, I'm Tag-Man!

I-I-I-I live in the tag!

I-I-I am the tag!

I'm Tag-Man!

Tag --
Tag of the episode...man!

"Did you get any of that?"

When the --yeah, when
an episode's over, look out,

because, yaaaah,
here comes Tag-Man!

And I'm --I'm crazy!
Tag-Man!

Yeah!
I'm --I'mma tag your ass!

Tag that ass.

Tag-Ass-Man!

I'm an Ass-Man now!

I'm a --I'm a Tag-Man!

Here's what you get.
Here's your tag!

Yeah, you want some more?

You want --you want some more
tag you sick piece of shit?!

I'm --because I'm Tag-Man!

I miss my wife.

Too bad.
This is it!

Tag-Man, yeah!

Did you get any of that?

﻿PRINCIPAL:
Principal Vagina here...

Don't let the name fool you.
I'm very much in charge...

reminding you that tonight is
our annual Flu Season Dance.

I don't know how many times
I have to say this,

but if you have the flu,
stay home.

Hey.

The Flu Season Dance is about
awareness, not celebration.

[ SIGHS ]

You don't bring dead babies
to Passover.

Okay. Here we go.
H-Hey, Jessica. Uh...

What's up, Morty?
[ SNEEZES ]

What are you doing?

- Um...
- Wait, wait.

Were you about to talk...
to her?

Well... I mean, I was
thinking about it.

Dude, stay in your league.

Look at how hot she is.
You don't see me going...

to a bigger school
in a wealthier district

and hitting on their
prettiest girl.

Gee, thanks, Brad.

I throw balls far.

You want good words?

Date a languager.

JERRY:
Try not to worry about it, Morty.

You're a good kid,
and there's not a premium

on that right now,
but you'll be getting girls

sometime after Brad's
out of shape.

[ SIGHING ]
You're missing the point, Dad.

I don't want girls.
I want Jessica.

Ah, well, I remember
feeling that way

about a young lady named
"your mom,"

and that's not an urban diss.

Your mom was my Jessica.

I remember the first time
I saw her.

I thought...
- "I should get her pregnant,

and then she'll have
to marry me."

I beg your pardon, Rick...
inappropriate.

Sorry, please proceed
with your story

about banging my daughter
in high school.

I'm not sure you wanna take
romantic advice from this guy, Morty.

His marriage is hanging
from a thread.

My marriage is fine, thank you.

Jerry, it's your house...
whatever you say it is

is how it is... but I think
a blind man could see

that Beth is looking
for the door.

I barely have a reason to care,
and even I noticed.

Come on, Rick! Don't talk
about my parents like that.

Listen, Morty, I hate
to break it to you,

but what people call "love"

is just a chemical reaction that
compels animals to breed.

It hits hard, Morty,
then it slowly fades,

leaving you stranded
in a failing marriage.

I did it.
Your parents are gonna do it.

Break the cycle, Morty.

Rise above. Focus on science.

[ SLURPS ]

All right, well, I'm gonna go
get dressed for the dance.

Yeah, I'm just going to...
check on your mom.

[ DOG BARKING ]

Morty, hand me
that screwdriver, huh?

I'm almost finished making
my ionic defibulizer, Morty.

It's gonna be great.
- Hey, listen, Rick.

Y-Y-You know how you said
that, you know,

love is a chemical
and all that stuff from earlier?

Well, I was thinking, you know,

w-w... could you make some sort
of chemical thing happen

inside of Jessica's mind,
you know,

so where she falls in love
with me

and all that sort of thing?

You know, like, some sort
of love potion or something?

Morty, that's such
a poor use of my time.

It's beneath me.
Hand me the screwdriver.

You know what?
No, Rick!

I'm not gonna hand you
the screwdriver.

I-I'm not gonna hand you
anything ever again, Rick!

I'm always helping you with this
and that and the other thing.

W-W-W-W-W-What about me,
Rick?

W-W-W-W-Why can't you just
help me out once...

once... for once?

[ GROANS ]
You're growing up fast, Morty.

You're growing into a real big
thorn straight up into my ass.

Listen, this is called oxytocin.

I extracted it from a vole.

Do you know what a vole is,
Morty?

You know what a vole is?
It's a... it's a rodent

that mates for life, Morty.

This is the chemical released
in a mammal's brain, you know,

that makes it fall in love.

I just gotta... [BURPS]
combine it with your DNA.

Oh, well, okay.

A hair, Morty.
I need one of your hairs.

This isn't
"Game of Thrones."

Ow!

All right, Morty, whoever
you smear this stuff on

will fall in love with you,
and only you, forever.

Are you happy now, Morty?
- Heck, yeah!

Thank you, Grandpa Rick.

Hey, there's no...
dangers or anything,

or side effects, right?

W-W-W-What am I,
a hack?

Go nuts, Morty.
It's foolproof.

Eh, unless she has the flu.

Beth, do y-you still
love me?

Ugh, what kind
of question is that?

The "yes or no" kind?
[ LAUGHS NERVOUSLY ]

Jerry, do you want
homeless people to have homes?

Yes.

Are you gonna build them?

No.

Then what good was the "yes"?

Wait, i-is loving me the house
or the homeless people?

Loving you is work,
Jerry... hard work,

like building
a homeless shelter...

nobody wants to say
no to doing it,

but some people put the work in.

So, what do you say?
Do you see me working here?

Does this conversation seem
tedious to me?

Sort of.

Then I obviously
sort of love you, don't I?

[ CELLPHONE CHIMES ]

So stop asking, and maybe
I'll love you more.

Crap, they need me
at the horse hospital.

Puh! This late?

The racetrack
had a starlight derby.

There was a seven-horse
collision,

and Davin's there alone.

That's enough, Bradley!

We don't want you injuring
your ball-throwing arm.

Oh, come on,

Never leave me, Morty.
Never!

Uh, sure.
I mean, o-of course not.

W-What do you think that
was all about?

Who cares? Just hold me.

Let me go!
I love you, Morty!

[ SNEEZES ]

JERRY: She's gonna be alone
with that guy all night.

Yeah, Dad, digging
around the insides of horses.

It's not a very romantic setting.

RICK: Well, Summer,
there's always the possibility

that she made the whole
work thing up.

Maybe Davin's digging around
in her insides.

Grandpa, so gross!
You're talking about my mom.

Well, she's my daughter, Summer.

I outrank you.

Or family means nothing, in
which case don't play that card.

She's not responding
to my texts!

Careful, Dad.
Jealousy turns women off.

Well, isn't that convenient?

Not for the men
they cheat on, no.

Okay, I'm...
going to go out...

for some ice cream.

And maybe
stop by the hospital...

to support my wife...

with my confidence.
[ DOOR CLOSES ]

God, Grandpa,
you're such a dick.

I'm sorry, Summer. Your opinion
means very little to me.

How come you're not at this
stupid dance everyone loves?

Screw that.
I don't wanna get sick.

It's flu season.
- It is?

- Yeah.
- Uh-oh.

[ HIP-HOP MUSIC PLAYS ]

[ INDISTINCT SHOUTING ]

Morty, the principal and I
have discussed it,

a-a-and we're both insecure
enough to agree to a three-way!

I didn't realize
when I gave you that serum

that Jessica had the flu...
you know,

t-t-t-t-t-that might have been
valuable information for me!

What the hell is going on, Rick?

What does it look like?

T-T-T-The serum is
piggybacking on the virus.

It's gone airborne, Morty.

Oh, crap.
What are we gonna do, Rick?

It's gonna be fine,
Morty, relax.

I whipped up an antidote.

It's based on praying-mantis
DNA.

You know, praying mantises
are the exact opposite of voles.

I mean, they...
they mate once,

and then they, you know,
decapitate the partner.

I mean, it's a whole ritual.

It's really gruesome
and totally opposite.

There's no love at all.

I-I-I basically mixed this with
a more contagious flu virus.

It should neutralize
the whole thing, Morty.

It'll all be over very shortly.

[ INDISTINCT SHOUTING ]

Uh, by the way, Morty, I know
you didn't ask or anything,

but I'm not interested
in having sex with you.

These serums, they don't
work on anybody

related to you genetically.

Morty!

than science, Morty.

that could happen?

We interrupt "Pregnant Baby"
with breaking news.

This just in... Morty Smith's
whereabouts are still unknown.

What the hell?

to drink in here?

- Yes.
- Here's the adventure.

Some kind of alien...googa

has infested
the Kennedy Sex Tunnels.

I want it hunted down
and taken out.

Kennedy Sex Tunnels?

Naturally, you'll forget
you saw them,

along with, in order of
national embarrassment,

the Truman Cocaine Lounge,
the McKinley Hooker Dump,

and the Lincoln Slave Coliseum.

He didn't free them all.

And let me know
when you're done.

Maybe then we could
get a selfie?

Too busy, Morty.
Now tell me about this summit.

Is it a peace one
or a regular one?

[ BEEPING ]

[GROWLING]

[ZAP! ZAP! ZAP!]

[WHIMPERS]

Ugh. This sucks.

God, tell me about it.

Oh, man.
If you're not into it --

What do you mean?
Why would I be into it?

- It's lame.
- You're into lame stuff, Morty.

I thought young dumb people
considered it an honor

to work for presidents
or whatever the shit.

Maybe the first few times,
but this just sucks.

He treats us like Ghostbusters.

- We should talk to him.
- Yeah, that sounds fun.

Let's set some boundaries
with a spoiled control freak

that thinks he runs the world

and orders drone strikes
to cope with his insecurity.

It's either that
or more of this.

Third choice...

-"Minecraft."
- You like it now?

Got to be honest, Morty.
It's growing on me.

Notify the president.

- What do I tell him?
- Tell him the truth.

Tell him Rick and Morty
just blew off America.

[DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYS]

MORTY: You can use that wood
to make a chest.

RICK: Oh, good. Then I can
store all this wood

I'll need later
for chest-making.

MORTY: Okay. You're not
going to have fun

if you analyze everything.

This is what they'd rather do?

It's all in the transcript.

"Treats us like Ghostbusters."

So, Ghostbusters
aren't cool now?

I don't recall
signing that bill.

"Control freak."

"Orders drone strikes
to cope with..."

"insecurity."

Should we drone-strike them?

- That would prove him right!
- And blow him up.

Give me the phone.

RICK: Is this game popular
with autistic people?

Why would you say
something like that?

'Cause I'm starting to love it.

[CELLPHONE VIBRATING]

MORTY: "Failure to answer
is a felony offense"?

RICK:
Play it cool.

As far as he knows,
we're still in the tunnels.

SECRETARY OF DEFENSE:
[CHUCKLES]

When should we reveal
we can see them?

We're holding all
the cards right now.

We don't show any before
the time is right.

- Awesome.
- RICK: Yello?

Hi, guys.
U.S. President calling.

- How's it going?
- Oh, hey.

Just hard at work
on this sex tunnel gagoo.

I think it's kind of our
new archnemesis, you know?

It might take a while.

What do you think, Morty,
a month?

Fingers crossed, a month, yeah.

You lying dicks!

I see your asses playing
"Minecraft"!

I got you on satellite!

That's right.

What do you have to say
for yourselves?

Okay, obviously,
this looks bad, Mr. President.

I mean, what doesn't look bad

through an illegal
spy satellite?

Don't high-road me.

The two of you break
1,000 federal laws a day.

- Wow, really?
- That's pretty cool.

And, yes, yes, yes, yes,
you save the world now and then.

America returns that favor

by not holding the two of you
accountable to its laws.

- Oh!
- Oh! on, God.

We -- We didn't know
you saw it that way.

Well, it's nobody's fault.

We never had "the talk,"
so to speak.

RICK: Yeah. I mean,
the way we see it,

when we show up,
that's the favor to you.

Especially, you know,
when it turns out

you wanted someone to come over
just because you found

an "X-Files" monster
in your basement.

As for the reason you've never,
like, arrested us,

we assumed you just knew
that it was impossible,

like, if you tried.

You know, it wouldn't go well.

Wouldn't go well?
Can you elaborate?

I think one of your 1,000 laws
says, no, I can't elaborate.

Just trust me.
None of us want to go there.

Which we'll never have to.

By the way, we'll keep on
saving the Earth.

You know, we're --
we're happy to do that.

RICK: Yeah, but not because
it contains America --

because moving to a new version
of Earth is a bitch and a half.

But feel free to call us, you
know, as -- as, like, friends.

Yeah, like, if you ever
want to take a selfie --

So, are we cool?

PRESIDENT: Yes.
Thank you, gentlemen.

I told you, man!

I'm impressed, Morty.
That went really well.

[ INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS]

[SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYS]

I am Presidentress
of the Mega Gargantuans.

We named ourselves
before learning we were small.

Madam Presidentress,
I'm President of America,

which is basically the world,

but you didn't hear that
from me.

- I've come to --
- I know who you are.

We've already agreed
to a ceasefire

with your ambassadors,
Rick and Morty.

- Rick and Morty were here?
- Of course they were here.

They can shrink instantly
and teleport.

They told me to give you this.

They said it will stretch
as your cancer pill wears off

and your body awkwardly enlarges
at the rate of a '50s movie.

Are there pants?

They said you'd prefer
just a shirt.

Apparently, you have a need
to swing your dick around?

Rick and Morty escaped.

No shit.
Take me to the Pentagon.

We're at war
with Rick and Morty.

You'll want to make a stop
at the White House?

I have pants at the Pentagon,
Rhonda. It's in my contract.

I mean you need to call
a press conference.

Israel and Palestine have
announced a permanent ceasefire.

- What?
- They signed something called

"The Pretty Obvious If You
Think About It" accord.

Apparently, an anonymous
American diplomat

took them
to a "Star Wars" cantina,

where they smoked
perspective-enhancing

alien pheromones
through a laser hookah.

I still say it has to be Putin.

It was Rick and Morty,
you fucking dunce!

But you're getting
the credit, sir.

Your approval rating
just hit 100%.

Why would Rick
and Morty want that?

Because they're assholes!

I'm flattered,
but it takes a whole team

to achieve what we did today.

Thank you.

Well?

They haven't been
back home, sir.

We've got every possible
location under surveillance.

God damn it!
They're right here!

- They're here, God damn it!
- Code Red! We need backup!

Everybody relax.

Just waiting for you
in the only room

you can't blow up or spy on.

So, we're not changing
timelines for you,

but now you have
everything you want,

so you can forget we exist,
and we'll return the favor.

You couldn't say that in a text?

Well, since we won't be seeing
each other again, my --

Guys, we get it.
It's a Code Red. Enough.

My grandson has
worked hard for you,

and I feel like
he's earned a selfie.

Honestly, I could take it
or leave it at this point.

You're taking it.

No. What kind of fratty-ass
status move is that?

Get out of my office!

Seriously?
You're that stubborn?

He's the stubborn one.
I'm protecting my country.

Uh, from selfies?

From subordination
to hostile powers.

Uh, does China know about
that deal-breaker?

China doesn't piss
on the White House.

Well, why would they?
I'm sure it was expensive.

- Get out.
- Not without a selfie.

Arrest them.

Son, you have a right
to refuse his order,

and I guarantee you're going to
die if you touch me,

and there's no afterlife.
Everything just goes black.

Don't do it.

- Whoa, Rick!
- Okay. What was that?

- Death.
- What kind?

-Instant.
- There was no sound.

- He just died.
- Yeah, terrifying.

It's a terrifying thing
to watch happen.

It's called a deterrent.

You couldn't
just knock him out?

How is knocking out a deterrent?

Everyone wants to be
knocked out.

Nobody wants to be dead.

You committed murder
in the Oval Office.

- Now you can't leave.
- That's fine.

I said I'm not leaving
without a selfie.

Uh, I don't need a selfie.

And I'm saying
you aren't getting one

and you aren't leaving.

- So we agree?
- Yes. No. We disagree

because you think you're getting
a selfie and leaving.

Am I getting a selfie?

- Never.
- Then I'm never leaving.

- Exactly.
- See?

Does anyone have a shot?

Yes, nine people.
I can show you.

- But I wouldn't recommend --
- Open fire!

God, you are dumb!

Get the President out of here!

- Bad idea.
- Wait. Why?

Because if there isn't
someone in here

that they're not
supposed to kill,

they're going to wreck
the place trying to kill me.

As long as you live,
no matter where you are,

if it isn't in a selfie
with him, I'll be here.

Jesus!
He's not a fucking god!

You don't know what I am!

And you don't know
what I can do!

Geez, it's -- it's cool, Rick!

I could be a clone.
I could be a hologram.

We could be clones

controlled with special headsets

that the real Rick and Morty
are wearing

while they're fucking

to be awful and stupid.

of her job title?!

and talk to each other
about something...

over with, nerd.

- Don't worry, Morty!

to a chemical that is
altering your mind.

truth of all --

you're getting your
ass kicked on a train.

fucking worked.

I brought you here.

my anthology with your

limitless potential,
propelling it to

its final stop --
beyond the fifth wall.

You idiot. Our potential
isn't limitless.

You'll never break
the fifth wall

before you've burnt
us out.

Is that so?
Oh, well. Win-win.

w-what's he doing?

He's trying to tap
into us, Morty.

Resist.

I can't believe you're finally
headed off to college.

you were gonna be
17 forever.

For, like,
16 years, at least.

Shit. He's taking
the good stuff, Morty.

Wait, is --
is any of this canon?

It could have been.

Oh, dear.

Are there things Rick Sanchez
holds sacred after all?

How did you find us?

I trusted you!

Don't blame others
for your bad decisions.

Resist, Morty!
Resist before he burns us out!

Oh, too late now!

What's wrong, Rick?

Don't you want to see
how your story ends?!

Holy shit, Rick.
What do we --

There -- there --
there's now way out!

You're right, Morty.

Sometimes it does seem
like there's no way out.

Like it's hopeless.

But remember, there's always
someone there for us.

Who?

My best friend
and personal savior,

Jesus Christ.

What?! You -- you don't
believe in God.

But He believes
in us, Morty.

You know, I thought
Iwas the inventor,

but the greatest
invention of all

is the free gift
of Eternal Life.

Is this --
are you fucking with me?

Oh, trust me, Morty.

I've done plenty of
effed up stuff in my life.

But it's never too late
to accept Christ.

Jesus is always
knocking at the door.

All we have to do
is open it and let Him

into our hearts.
How?

I'm so glad you asked,
Morty.

Just close your eyes
and go to Him in prayer.

Like this.

Heavenly Father.Heavenly Father.

Thank you for sending
your only begotten son.

What a second, no!
What are you doing?!

Jesus, I accept you
into my heart.

No! This sucks.

Stop! You guys would
never do this.

Fill me with your Spirit.

Make me a shining city
on a hill for you.

- No! No!
- Make me born again.

- No!
- In Jesus' name, we pray.

- Amen.
- Amen.

- Amen!
- You did it!

Way to go, Morty!Crossy.

Bible-Saurus.
You made it.

We wouldn't miss this
for anything!

You said it,
Mr. Celery.

What the fuck
is all of this?!

Greatest story
ever told, Story Lord.

No, it's not.
It's awful!

I beg your pardon?

Ah!

Goddamn.

My Lord and my God!

- No! No! It sucks in here.
- Let's get the fuck

outta here. Go, now.

Ugh.
We're safe, Morty.

Nobody ever wanted
to see that shit.

Wh-what's gonna happen
to Story Lord?

He gets to spend eternity in
every writer's hell --

the Bible.
I don't know.

Some people actually
like that stuff.

Seems kind of cynical.

I just don't like taking
cheap shots, you know?

Cheap shots?
Morty, we were literally

saved by Jesus Christ.

Tell me in any way
how that's offensive.

This was
a little confusing,

but I guess it brought us
closer together, you know?

Tested our demons.

Made us believe in
ourselves more than ever.

Yeah.
You're right, Morty.

We got all that meta-canon
shit outta the way

and now we can
just be ourselves.

Now what do you say we
bring thistrain

into the station.

Oh, shit.

So what do you think?

Wow. Where did you
get this thing?

The Citadel of Ricks
Gift Shop.

Do you really like it?
I didn't think you'd even care.

What? Morty. No.
I love it.

You did the most
important thing.

You -- you bought
something.

What?You bought something.

With money. God.
I love money so much, Morty.

Are you being sarcastic?Merchandise, Morty.

Your only purpose in life is to
buy and consume merchandise.

And you did it.
You went into a store --

an actual honest to God store --
and you bought something.

You didn't ask questions
or raise ethical complaints.

You -- you just looked straight
into the bleeding jaws

of capitalism
and said "Yes, daddy, please."

And I'm...
I'm so proud of you.

I only wish you could've
bought more.

I -- I love buying things
so much, Morty.

Rick, are -- are you --

do you need to go
to the hospital?

I love you, Morty.
Give Grandpa a kiss.

Give -- give -- gimme --
give Grandpa a kiss.

Lips if you want.

What-- whatever
you're comfortable with.

Some cultures do that.

That was sweet.
Thank you.

I -- I love you.
You're my little buddy.

Okay.

Let's watch some
Interdimensional Cable.

So you're saying
my father

and His kingdom...

Well, yes --
it's based on the fusion

of a Sumerian god
named "Ya"

and a Mesopotamian god
named "Way."

And we're in
a toy train?

Yes.

It's enough to really
make you question

all of existence,
isn't it?

So what do you think you're
gonna do about it?

I'm gonna do
what I've always done.

I'm gonna get the fuck
outta here.

Father of omens!
Give me blood beyond sight!

Hey, what
the fuck, Morty?

The train you got me just
completely derailed itself.

There's blood all over
the windows on it.

Oh, man, I'm sorry, Rick.
I guess I'll return it.

Return --
Are you insane?

Did you hear
nothing I said?

Buy another one,
Morty.

Consume, Morty.

Nobody's out there shopping
with this fucking virus.

Where's your
fucking wallet?!

Okay, God,
it's just such a plain --

I'm trying to come up
with a mnemonic device.

You could connect it
to not dying.

I know, I know! You think that
would sear it right in,

but it just speaks
to the sheer forgettability.

Oh, God.
I-I-I'm, uh, so sorry.

Uh, uh, oh, God.

Starts with a "B" --

Congratulations to your
government, business,

or terror cell on its
acquisition of

the NX-5 Planet Remover
by Xamaxax

in partnership with
Wrangler jeans.

The NX-5's industry-leading

tachyon beams eliminate planets
twice as fast as the NX-4S

with half the battery and zero
built-in fatal design flaws.

That's right.
No more secret hole

that blows the whole thing up
when you shoot it.

Your enemies will say
it's unfair.

We say it's about time.
- Damn it.

We risked our lives for that?

You did your best.
Maybe you need a break.

Don't you ever miss Earth?I don't have to miss it.

I'm technically still there.

My dad made a perfect clone
of me to take my place.

Boy, that Rick.

So, if you do go back,

what happens to the clone?

Does it have, like,
a proximity-triggered device

in its neck?Who cares? Are we done?

Sure.
Unless you want me to remove

the proximity-triggered device
from your neck.

Think it's a bomb?

Man, what if this is
how you found out

he never wanted you back,

that he loved the clone
more than you?

How crazy would that be?
Aaaaaaaaaaaaah!!

Uh, Dad, how long are the days
on this planet?

Uh, computer, how long
are the days on this planet?

[ SCREAMING CONTINUES ]

42 hours.

All right, well,
those are the two choices,

'cause cob planet is
off the table.

Now let's take a vote.

MAN: Well, it's official.

The obscure planet
known as Earth,

formerly the hiding place
of interstellar terrorist

and fugitive Rick Sanchez,

has just become
the 6,048th planet

to join the Galactic Federation.

The plucky little ball
of water and dirt,

which is where it gets its name,

is dominated by seven billion
primate-descended natives

who love to eat spaghetti
and pray to kangaroos.

Spaghetti, kangaroos?
I've gotta check this place out.

[BOTH LAUGH] Well, you can.

Contact the Ministry of Tourism
for details.

Up next,
teenagers are calling it

[GROWLS AND SQUEALS]

And it's not what you think.

What are you...
What did you do that for?

Dramatic effect.

Good morning, family.
Oh, do I smell bacon?

Yes, we discovered
a species of tiny pig

off the coast of New Australia

about 30 yards east.
Or 300 yards west.

We'd offer you some,

but we hunted it to extinction
for breakfast.

Well, I thought
I'd walk to the South Pole

and do a little bit
of exploring.

If you guys need me, just yell

or throw something so hard

that it goes around the world
and hits me.

[ DOOR SHUTS ]
Okay, now that he's gone,

can we please talk about
our situation?

Dad, you can't talk about people
behind their back.

You know, it's a small world.

Please, he's in the South Pole!

And we need to have
a serious conversation.

[ INSECTS CHIRPING ]

[ THUNDER RUMBLES ]

[ WIND HOWLING ]

South Pole discovered, baby!

Ohhhh!

Oh fuck! An ice cave?

Shit!

Things just keep on
getting better.

Wow, it's the planet's core.

JERRY: I'm just saying,

we keep acting
like there's only two options,

but there's not.

So, yes, if we went
back to Earth,

as long as Rick was out there,
they'd wanna interrogate us.

But, and this is
purely hypothetical,

what if we turned your father in
to the government?

Jerry, so help me god,

if you ever bring this up again,
no more bacon.

There already is no more bacon!

This world sucks!
Our life sucks!

Why are we doing this
for someone

that would never do anything
for anyone but himself?

MORTY:
That's not the point, Dad!

We love Rick...
f-for the most part.

SUMMER: Yeah, you don't love
people in hopes of a reward,

Dad, you love them
unconditionally.

That's very good, kids.
I'm proud of you.

Okay, so let me
get this straight.

For the rest of your lives,

no matter how much it hurts you,

no matter how much it
destroys our children's futures,

we're gonna do whatever
Rick wants, whenever he wants?

- ALL: Yes.
- Why?!

Because I don't want him to
leave again, you dumb asshole!!

Hey. Uh...

I was gonna hope over
to the Gloppydrop system,

get some ice cream.

You... You want me to come with?

Don't you need my brain waves
for camouflage or something?

I'll be okay. Bye, Morty.

Rick?

You're not leaving, right?

Yeah, I am. To get ice cream.

So, you're coming back?

Morty, if you go to where
there's a bunch of ice cream

and then you don't come back,

you haven't
actually gotten ice cream,

you've just gone
where ice cream is.

Rick, I can handle it if you go,

but you'll break Mom's heart.

And I won't forgive you
for that.

Where's the van, Morty?

It's over the horizon
in the driveway.

I'll make you a pair of pants
on the way.

It's a Rick and Jerry adventure!

Rick and Jerry episode!

[DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYS]

Then I thought,
"Hey, what about Jerry?

He's -- He's good
with regular folk."

This is a real situation
where -- where --

where Jerry could really shine.

He's a master convincer."

Rick, I'm not an idiot.
I know what this is.

Oh. Okay, well, I told Morty,

"Look, parents get divorced.
They get sad. He'll be fine,"

but I think he's worried
you're gonna, you know...Pbht!

And you know how Morty gets
when he gets emotional.

It impedes my work.

So, I told him I'd take you out
and give you a win.

Wait. My son asked you
to take me

On some kind of pity adventure
to keep me from killing myself?

Wait, w-what
did you think it was?

An execution.

Geez!
You really do need a win.

No!
I-l don't know.

I mean, you never made me
the pants, so --

So, you thought
I was gonna drive you

into the middle of the galaxy
and shove you

into the vacuum of space
with your dick hanging out?

And we're seeing how you'd act
if that were about to happen?

I mean, shit, I'll make you
the pants right now.

Take me two seconds
to make you pants.

- I have pants at home!
- Jerry, if I make pants,

they'll be better than
your pants at home.

Also, if I wanted to kill you --

Yeah, I get it.
It'd be amazing.

Please, take me home.

I'll tell my son we had
an amazing adventure.

Well, if it's all the same,

could we go
get our story straight?

Because you're a terrible liar.

You called me
a master convincer!

You believed me?

Huh. This seems...kind of fancy.

Jerry, for all you know,
this is the equivalent

of an alien truck stop.

You have no frame of reference.

You're in a universe

But, yes, it is super fancy.

of my home, stole my family.

Then we are brothers,
and you have wondered

what your life could have been

about having a vagina.

Would you help me kill him?

What? No!

Oh, you really moved on.

There is a popular attraction
here called the Whirly Dirly.

to his death?

I'm only asking you
to go on a ride with Rick,

get off the ride without Rick,
and go home to your family,

where you can...
wonder about having a vagina.

Beth!

Bet you're glad I think
Kindles are dumb now.

BETH: I can't help
but feel a little guilty.

I didn't peg Lucy for a rapist.

What does a rapist
look like exactly, Beth?

Is it a Slavic man
wearing a denim jacket

with a patchy beard
and the scent of cheap champagne

wafting over his
blister-pocked lips?

What?

Well, at least you got
all this free stuff.

Should be enough to satisfy your
Titanic Jones for a while.

[ GRUNTS ] I'm not going to fit.

Beth, listen to me.
You're going to get outta here.

You're gonna go on, and...

It's debris.

what a bitch you are.

Guys, seriously.
Nancy?

Summer, you're a bad person.

All you care about is having
popular people like you.

That's not what

what he stood for,

but it's certainly not
what he died for.

Next time I party,
I'm just gonna focus

on getting totally wrecked.

You're so wise.

[ MUMBLES ]

May I assist you with that?

Uh, sure, yeah.
Thanks.

Morty, do you know what
"wubba lubba dub dub" means?

Uh, that's just Rick's
stupid nonsense catchphrase.

It's not nonsense at all.

In my people's tongue, it means,

"I am in great pain.
Please help me."

Well, I got news for you.
He's saying it ironically.

No, Morty.
Your grandfather is, indeed,

in very deep pain.

That is why he must numb
himself.

- Come on, um...
- Birdperson.

Come on, Birdperson.
Rick's not that complicated.

He's just a huge asshole.

Then why do you care so much
if you are no longer allowed

to continue on your adventures
together?

It appears fate has presented
you with an opportunity

to free yourself of Rick
forever.

You know what? You're right.
I shouldn't even care.

This is probably the best thing
that could have happened to me.

I'm sick of having adventures
with Rick.

My people have another saying...

"gubba nub nub doo rah

Lt means, "whatever lets you
sleep at night."

But it's worth the risk.

They're delicious.

you're explaining alien cereal.

Relax, Mr. Smith.
You're in an alien hospital.

I mean, to you,
it's an alien hospital.

To me,
you're just in a hospital.

There's another matter
we need to discuss with you.

Okay.

An hour ago, Shrimply Pibbles,

the galaxy's most influential
civil rights leader,

was brought to this hospital's
emergency room,

where he is currently fighting
for his life.

My god.

Mr. Smith, Shrimply Pibbles'
life can be saved

if we replace
his heart with your human penis.

I see. Wait, what?

It's perfect.

The configuration of veins,

the ratio of thickness
to elasticity,

the delicate asymmetry
of what you call your balls,

and with relatively
few adjustments,

your genitals can be molded
into a functioning heart

for the most important man
in the universe.

- Yeah, but... I mean...
- Oh, forget it!

I told you this was
a waste of time!

Have respect, Yarp.

The Earth man's world
is tiny and undeveloped.

He knows nothing
of the genocides of Clorgon

or the tragic events
of 65.3432.23/14.

ALIEN: And even if he did,
he wouldn't comprehend them.

I've dwelt among the humans.

Their entire culture
is built around their penises.

It's funny to say
they are small.

It's funny to say they are big.

I've been at parties

where humans have held
bottles, pencils, thermoses

in front of themselves
and called out,

"Hey, look at me.
I'm Mr. So-And-So-Dick.

I've got such-and-such
for a penis."

I never saw it fail
to get a laugh.

All right! That's enough!

You guys are talking
about my species.

We understand genocide.
We do it sometimes.

Then you would give your penis

so that Shrimply Pibbles
might live?

- Stop asking!
- Yes, I will!

That's right, assholes.

Take my penis. Take it all!

And tell Shrimply Pibbles

that when the galaxy
came calling,

Jerry Smith from Earth
didn't flinch!

at that lady over there
getting coffee.

What's up with her face?

Is she human,
or is she like Worf?

You know, Worf from "Star Trek,"

how he has all that shit
all over his face,

but he's just a human
in a costume, you know?

what else is on, huh?

for a Jan Michael Vincent

He can't be at two quadrants
at once.

Hey, Rick, who...
Who is Jan Michael Vincent?

Oh, man, I'm trying to
remember, Morty.

Jan Michael Vincents
are used up.

I need a goddamn
Jan Michael Vincent.

Is it important that we know
who Jan Michael Vincent was...

- In order to get this?
- Nope.

I refuse to send the legislation
that allows more

than eight Jan Michael Vincents
to a precinct.

it's time to Michael down

of... of... of a whole different

how much longer
is this gonna be?

Shouldn't I be
back at school by now?

Are you joking me?

I mean, look at all the
crazy crap surrounding us.

W-what the hell is that thing?

You think you're gonna see
that kind of thing at school?

that thing.

We're surrounded by monsters.

That's kind of the reason
why I want to leave.

You see what we just
stumbled upon, Morty?

Any idea what that
is down there?

The Mega trees?

That's right, Morty...
the Mega trees

with the Mega fruit on them.

And that's what I'm
talking about, Morty.

That's where my seeds are.

If we would have done
what you wanted,

I would have never
have found them,

because y... because you're
so in love with school.

All right, all right.

So, what's so special about
these seeds, anyways?

You ask a lot of
questions, Morty.

Not very charismatic.

It makes you kind of
an [BURPS] under...

[BURPS] underfoot figure.

Just take these shoes, Morty.

They're Sp... [BURPS]
special grappling shoes.

When you're wearing these
things... Ba... these babies,

you can basically just walk on
any surface you want, Morty...

up, down, below,
turn around to the left.

These things really bring
it all together.

Aah!

You have to turn them on, Morty!

[ THUDS ]

The shoes have to be turned on!

BETH:
I am not putting my father in a home!

He just came back into my life,

and you want to grab him and
stuff him under a mattress like

last month's Victoria's Secret?

I told you... I was ordering you
something for Valentine's Day.

More importantly, your father is
a horrible influence on our son.

Everything cool in here, Beth?

something great today.

There's nothing more noble and
free than the heart of a horse.

with that guy, I will
come to the hotel room

and blow my brains out
all over your naked bodies.

Look, I appreciate the
stress you're under, but

Morty was having trouble in
school way before my dad moved

in, and the only influence I
can see Rick having is that,

for the first time in his life,
Morty has a friend.

getting down here.

But do you think you'll still be
able to help me [BURPS] collect

my seeds, Morty?

Are you kidding me?!

That's it, Rick!

That's the last straw!

I can't believe this...
I'm sitting here with both

of my legs broken,
and you're still asking me

about getting those seeds?!

but even Hitler cared about
Germany or something.

my broken legs instantly.

so good in my life.

Thank you.

Don't worry about it, Morty.

Just come help me get these
seeds, all right, buddy?

Sure thing, Rick.

Not that you asked, Morty,
but what just happened

there is I went into a future
dimension with such advanced

medicine that they had
broken-leg serum at every

corner drugstore.

The stuff was all over
the place, Morty.

Wow, that's pretty crazy, Rick.

There's just one problem,
Morty...

one little hang-up.

The dimension I visited was so
advanced,

they had also halted
the aging process,

and everyone there was young,
Morty,

and they had been forever.

I was the only old
person there, Morty.

It was [BURPS] like I was some
sort of, you know, celebrity,

walking around.

I-I was fascinating to them.

There were a lot of attractive
women there, Morty, and they...

they... they...
they all wanted time with me.

I had a lot of fun with
a lot of young ladies,

but I spent so much time there,

my interdimensional
portal device...

it's got no charge left, Morty.

It's got no charge left.

What?!

It's as good as garbage, Morty.

It's not gonna
work anymore, Morty.

Oh, geez, Rick, that's not good.

W-what are we gonna do?

I-I have to be back
at school right now.

How are we gonna get back home?

There's ways to
get back home, Morty.

It's just... it's just gonna
be a little bit of a hassle.

We're gonna have to go through
Interdimensional Customs,

so you're gonna have
to do me a real solid.

Uh-oh.

When we get to Customs,

I'm gonna need you to take
these seeds into the bathroom,

and I'm gonna need you
to put them way up

inside your butthole, Morty.

In my butt?

Put them way up inside there,
as far as they can fit.

Oh, geez, Rick.

I really don't want
to have to do that.

Well, somebody's got
to do it, Morty.

Th-these seeds aren't gonna get
through Customs unless they're

in someone's rectum, Morty.

[ WHIMPERS ]

And they'll fall
right out of mine.

I've done this
too many times, Morty.

I mean, you're young.

You've got your whole
life ahead of you,

and your anal cavity is
still taut, yet malleable.

You got to do it
for Grandpa, Morty.

Y-you've got to put these
seeds inside your butt.

In my butt?

Come on, Morty.

Please, Morty.

You have to do it, Morty.

Oh, man.

has attended this school for a

total of seven hours over

you notify us?

getting the messages

I've been leaving with Morty's
grandfather?

him out of school.

this to a racial place.

to eat a Flimflam...

I can't abide bureaucracy.

I don't like being told
where to go and what to do.

I consider it a violation.

Did you get those seeds
all the way up your butt?

Yeah, Rick.

Let's just get
this over with, okay?

I mean, these things are pointy.
They hurt.

That means they're good ones.

You're a good kid, Morty.

valuable to my work.

I are very disappointed in...

in this behavior.

No? No takers?

be touching that stuff.

It's beyond your reasoning.

and watch Paul Newman movies

on VHS and mentally scar the
Boy Scouts every Christmas.

What does that mean?

Morty, stay out of this.

You are obviously not capable
of judging these situations on your own.

to say about Morty?

That he's stupid or something?

Oh, don't high-road us, Dad.

is the last child that needs to

be missing classes.

you mean by that.

Can... can... can you be a
little bit more specific?

disability or something.

Is that what you want us to say?

I do?

Well, duh doy, son.

want to compete in this world,

you got to work twice as hard.

Thermodynamics.

"The increment in the internal
energy of a system is equal to

the increment of heat
supplied to the system."

Wow! I'm so smart!

But...

I told the both of you...

school is stupid.

It's not how you learn things.

He has a special mind.

That's why he's
my little helper.

He's like me.

science stuff later in his life.

happening here to stop.

You... you really wear
the pants around here.

I just want you to know,
between us, from now on,

it's gonna be 100%
honesty and open,

clear communication.

Frank Palicky was
frozen to death today!

No idea what you're
talking about.

[ SOBBING ]

Okay.

Well, uh, Morty,
it's your bedtime in an hour.

Don't stay up all night again.

This is good, though.

This can work.

I think we can be a family.

And now, Beth,
if you'll have me,

I would love to have you.

You know what?

Okay.

Holy cow, Rick.

I didn't know hanging out with
you was making me smarter.

Full disclosure, Morty...
it's not.

Temporary superintelligence is
just a side effect of the

Mega seeds dissolving in
your rectal cavity.

Aw, man.

Yeah, and once those
seeds [BURPS] wear off,

you're gonna lose most
of your motor skills,

and you're also gonna lose
a significant amount of

brain functionality
for 72 hours, Morty.

Starting [BURPS]
right about now.

Ohh, man.

[ GROANING ]
Oh, geez! Ohh.

I'm sorry, Morty.
It's a bummer.

In reality, you're
as dumb as they come.

And I needed those
seeds real bad,

and I had to give them up just
to get your parents off my back,

so now we're gonna
have to go get more.

And then we're gonna go on even
more adventures after that,

Morty.

And you're gonna keep your mouth
shut about it, Morty,

because the world is full of
idiots that don't understand

what's important,

and they'll tear us apart,
Morty.

But if you stick with me, I'm
gonna accomplish great things,

Morty, and you're gonna be
part of them, and together,

we're gonna run around, Morty.

We're gonna do all kinds of
wonderful things, Morty.

Just you and me, Morty.

Oh, no, no.

The outside world
is our enemy, Morty.

We're the only [BURPS]
friends we've got, Morty.

It's just Rick and Morty...

Beth! You'll want to see this.

- What is it?
- It's a small, hinged panel...

with a tiny amount
of space behind it.

If you can find one, too,

we should be safe for hours,
maybe days!

You stay put, Jerry.

I'll send help, if I make it.

You don't want to find
your own little hatch?

Jerry, I believe that,
if you hide by yourself,

you might survive
and I believe I,

by myself, have a shot
of getting out of here,

but the two of us, together?

I don't know.

Good luck.

But I also think that,
one day, you'll all look back

on being in high school
with Tiny Rick and Morty,

who I hear had a great
party last night.

So, class dismissed.
You've got the day off!

All right! Good work,
Mr. Goldenfold!

Yeah, get outside. Read a book.

Put on some sunscreen, Danielle!

Hey, what's up, Summer?
Ooh, nice top.

Thanks. Tiny Rick,
you think you might be

getting back into
your old body tonight?

No can do.
Tonight's the big dance.

And Morty's bringing Jessica.
He needs his tiny wing man.

- BOTH: Tiny Rick!
- [ LAUGHS ]

Okay, but if not tonight, when?

I don't know.
When I feel like it?

Damn, girl!
You need to chill out!

This whole thing was your
idea, in the first place,

and, now, you're trying
to rush it along.

Yeah, and you know what?
I like high school.

I like hanging out. Tiny Rick!

But what if the you
that likes it isn't you?

[ LAUGHTER ]
- Oh!

BOTH: Oh, Summer!

It's just Rick
in a younger body.

What's the... What's...
What's... What's...

What's the...
What's the problem?

Look at his art, Morty.

I've got an emo streak.
Part of what makes me so rad.

Why does it say "help me
Morty and Summer!"?

Come on, Summer,
that's the title of the art.

Why was Knight Rider
called Knight Rider?

The car's name was Kitt.
Nobody rode Michael Knight.

You're overthinking it, Summer.
I'm Tiny Rick!

Grandpa, I think that,
when you put your mind

into this body's young brain,

it did what young brains do...

It shoved the bad
thoughts into the back

and put a wall around them.

But those bad thoughts
are the real Rick.

The fact that you're old,

the fact that we're all
going to die one day,

the fact that the universe
is so big,

nothing in it matters...
Those facts are who you are.

So you're trapped in there
and you can only come out

in the form of
Tiny Rick's teen angst!

Well, Summer, I hear

Toby Matthews
isn't into psycho chicks.

Can't think of anyone that is.

I'll see you motherfuckers
at the dance! Tiny Rick!

Morty, you have to help me!

Summer, he's happy! I'm happy!

I-I-Is that why
you're doing this,

you don't want me
and Rick to be happy?

- No.
- Then get your shit together!

Get it all together
and put it in a backpack.

All your shit, so it's together.

And if you gotta
take it somewhere,

take it somewhere, you know?

Take it to the shit store
and sell it

o-or put it in a shit museum.
I don't care what you do!

You just gotta get it together.

You are going to help me.

- Jerrys.

You want Jerry?
I don't even want Jerry.

I want Jerrys.

The value of his subservience
is wasted on you.

I will use it to dominate
the universe.

Ah ha ha. Boy, Jerry must
think I'm pretty stupid,

for you to be this stupid.

Wouldn't it make more sense

to put my dumbass husband
in this chair,

so you can make an army
of your badass self?

There could never be more

Tiny Rick, this conversation

is gonna break

You're a great student
and the fact that

you're an 80-Year-Old man
in a clone body,

it never bothered me.

But this here is another matter.

it was in your locker.

and won't take it public,
However,

they can't have students

to get off my brother.

Who's your brother?

Oh, this?

Forgot he was there, haha.

Wait.
What are you saying?

I'm saying that you've
been great, Steve,

but we've been thinking
it's time for a new chapter.

We?
Uh, this is Shane.

He'll be handling
the day-to-day.

It's an honor
to meet you, sir.

I might only be two minutes old,
but I know you're a legend.

She doesn't care
about us.

She just wants her fuckin'
host back.

I don't know what to do.Oh, now you want my help.

Too late for that.Come on, man.

What is this shit?

You don't get to
do this to me.

We were in eggs together.

Oh, fuck since
we were in eggs.

Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah,
now you respect, like,

the biological
institutions now?

Fuck you.
All you care about

is "progress"
and society and skyscrapers.

You don't care about
fuckin' biology.

Oh, yeah, well, what
the fuck?

You -- How you you haven't laid
and egg inside this old man yet?

Because I do what I want.

Because someone's gotta
stand up for what's right.

Why do you hate her
so much?

Because she took you away
from me!

Whoa, man.
Jesus Christ.

No, I-I didn't, I --Whoa, whoa, whoa. No.

It's cool.

I feel the same way.

Oh, my God, I...

I wish we could suck
on each other.

I wanna suck on you, too.I'm gonna suck you so hard.

Suck me.
C-C-Can we do this?

A-A-Are we allowed to
do this?

I don't care.
I just want you.

Fuck all of this.

Let's just get the hell
outta here

and be whatever
the fuck we want.

That's evolution.
That's progress.

I want a family.
Can we have a family.

Yeah.

Oh, my God.

Holy shit.
Oh.

What are --
What are these things?!Do I look like I know?

Hey, wait a second.
How'd you know that last part?

You weren't there for that.I had to fill in some gaps.

Everyone around the office
knew about Steve and Bruce.

I've got a plan, okay.
You just have to follow my lead.

The punishment is...

death.Motherfucker. Summer!

You said you had a plan!Silence.

The council of Glorzos
has spoken.

More like
council of shit.

Glorzo is law.Silence.

The punishment is death.

By...
getting into their car.

Summer?
Shut up.

Yes, place them in the car.

Those pieces of shit.

No, no, no!
This is like torture.

No, I-I-I-I hate being
in my car.

You deserve it,
you pieces of shit.

And to make sure
the sentence is passed,

I shall be joining them.

In the car.

And we shall drive away
from here and die.

Oooookay.

Guess what, everybody.

It's me, the whiny guy
you never want to hear from.

She's trying to escape
with her family.

My time to shine.

Execute her.

Okay, plan B.
Morty, now.

Aah!

Jesus, Morty, that sucks.

Alright, stop playing,
Morty.

I-I got this.

Aah!

This is what we get
for evolving?

Sorry!
Sorry.

I-I'm sorry. We -- We --
We thought you were evil.

Why would you think that?

We had a giant tower
that blared "Glorzo is peace."

I know.
I -- Should -- Should we help?

- Boo!
- Oh, like that's helping.

Got it. Going.
Okay, we're gonna hit the road.

You're -- You're just going?You told us to go!

Once again,
I'm so sorry for what they --

You're part of this, too.
Boo!

We hate you the most.

Get out.

Jesus, Summer,
why'd you let these things

stay on us for so long?

I was working with a lot.

Just let me listen
to the podcast next time.

Nailed that landing.

Huh.
Neat-looking egg.

Okay, well, I'm not
cleaning up this shit.

Aah!

Maybe we, uh -- Maybe we don't
tell people about this one.

Did we at least
learn something?

That we suck
and everyone sucks?

I guess that counts.

Later, chodes.

Hit me on the next one.

You know, Rick,
I'm sure you wanna jump

into another crazy adventure,
but can we just relax

and maybe watch
some interdimensional cable?

I'm cool if you are.Honestly, that sounds great.

W-We don't need to try so hard,
you know.

Let's just take it easy
and riff, you know.

That's what I love about us.Me, too, buddy.

Do you suffer
from Alzheimer's?

Do you suffer from Alzheimer's?

Do you suffer
from Alzheimer's?

Do you suffer from Alzheimer's?

- Reggie?
- Do you suffer from Alzheimer's?

Reggie, you alright in there?

Mm, Rick, do you feel...

Oh, God,
I have to shit an egg.

Oh, my God, oh, shit.

Oh, it hurts.
Oh God,

is this how we die, Rick?
Is this how we die?!

I don't know, Morty.
I don't know! Aah!

- I don't want to shit an egg, Rick!
- I'm sorry, Morty.

I'm sorry! It's my fault.
It's all my fault!

Hey, you two. Did you --

Beth, your son is dying!
Say goodbye!

What are you --Say goodbye
to your little boy!

No, look away!

I'm making an egg, Mom.
I'm making an egg!

You said you'd keep me more
in the loop this year.

Look away, Beth!
Daddy loves you!

My ass!
My ass!

This is it, Morty!

It's full circle
from the pilot.

Full circle!

Oh, I guess we, uh --

I guess we both just had
to take a shit.

Yeah,
I-I-I guess we, uh...

Fucking gross.

Guys, clean it up.

Look at your dad.

Such a dork, keeping bees.

I mean, it's -- at least
it's interesting, though.

At least, like --
I wish my dad kept bees.

I mean,
it's kind of cute.

Like...
your dad keeps bees.

How old is your dad?

He's obviously
beekeeping age.

I don't know,
I think it's kind of sweet.

Summer, I want to
fuck your dad.

Oh, really?

﻿

Someone played Barry White
over the racetrack speakers,

and now there's a
seven-horse pregnancy.

Oh, uh --No, he can't watch
the kids. It's guys' night.


<i>the whole place -- the
whole planet will get blown up</i>

<i>-with a n-neutrino bomb.
-[ BEEP</i> ]

<i>And try to make it a-a lesson
about yourselves,</i>

<i>like</i> -- <i>like
how selfish you are</i> --

<i>are or something.</i>

<i>And also Hawaii.</i>

[ SIGHS ]
You guys hit the baskets.

I'll disarm the drunkenly
improvised neutrino bomb.

There's a 40% chance it's a dud,

but y-you should still
stay back.

- Morty, how many of these --
- Too many, Rick! Too many!

Man, I am really getting
high-roaded today.

<i>-[ DING ]
- That's a three-pointer.</i>

- Nice shot.
- Thank you.

You two make quite a team.

-[ GROANS]
- We all do.

Yeah, I guess.

<i>-[ DING ]
- That's a three-pointer.</i>

But you guys have always had
a -- an unspoken bond.

I mean <i>really</i> unspoken.

Like, let's-not-tell-my-husband
unspoken.

[ BUZZER]

We aren't married anymore, Alan.

Sure, but were we married

when you two were "stranded"
on Delphi Six for three days?

Because I <i>sensed</i> something
was weird when you came back,

but what do I know
about sensitivity?

I'm just
a phantom train conductor.

You're the pile of ordinary bugs
that fucked my wife!

<i>-[DING ]
- That's a three-pointer.</i>

Where the fuck
is the lead wire?

You always put it
in the weirdest place.

Um, uh, over here maybe?

Jesus Christ,
what a shitty neutrino bomb.

It's a miracle I ever
actually destroy anything.

Oh, I don't know.

You managed to destroy
just about everything today.

The villains, the heroes,

the lines between them,
my childhood.

Thank you.
I appreciate it, Morty.

I know you were sucking
the Kool-Aid

out of the Vindicators' dicks,

so the fact that I was right
about them

must be pretty hard to admit.

Yeah, it is.
You know why, Rick?

Because when you're an asshole,

it doesn't matter
how right you are.

Nobody wants to give you
the satisfaction.

I know. Everyone wants people
they like to be right.

That's why popular people
are fucking dumb.

And why your pretentious,
poorly written,

high-budget friends back there

can eat a double-decker
shit sandwich.

Disarmed.

Holy shit.
You're jealous.

Yes! Is that
what you want to hear?!

Did it feel good?

Did you like his six million
wriggling legs

more than my tragedy-stricken,

half-ghost,
half-tumescent penis?!

Guys, stop!

You're just proving
my asshole grandpa right!

You wish this was about sex!
We loved each other!

- We had a child together!
- What?!

I conceived a child
with Million Ants,

and it died inside me

because it was half a million
ants and half collapsing star!

And yes.
He was better than you.

- Yeah?
- One million times better.

All aboard, motherfucker!

[ ECHOING ] Stop!

[SCREAMING]

Oof!
Didn't see that coming.

Is that sarcasm?

I don't want you slipping away
when this is over.

All of these deaths
are on your hands.

Okay, come on,
maybe a couple of them,

but definitely
not the Train Guy.

- Oof!
- All of them.

Okay.

<i>-[ DINGING ]
- Congrats. You did it.</i>

<i>All right, by now,
I've been pretty clear</i>

<i>that I think the Vindicators
are [COUGHS] full of shit.</i>

<i>But...you do have one thing
that I'll never have.</i>

<i>And that thing is the only part
of the Vindicators</i>

<i>with any value to me.</i>

<i>If you know what it is,
place it on the platform.</i>

<i>Guess wrong, and the pla-planet
will explode.</i>

<i>And probably the solar system,</i>

<i>'cause I kind of fuckin'
eyeballed the neutrino bombs</i>

<i>on this one.</i>

So what's the trick? Morty,
you're the Drunk Rick expert.

I think...no matter
what we put on there, we die.

He said it's the part
of the Vindicators he values.

That means nothing.

He wants our last moment alive

to be spent knowing
how few fucks he gave.

Jesus! Okay,
open to second opinions.

It could --
It could be Morty.

- What?
- Hey, I don't know.

I mean, look, when I get drunk,

I get stupid and emotional,
and there's no logic to it.

It's, like,
it's possible I got so drunk

I felt like I was losing Morty
to the Vindicators,

and maybe this is
my way of saying, "Okay,

you can have him, but only if
you know how important he is.

Otherwise, I'll kill you."

That is a...
really specific guess.

Look, I-l -- There's
nothing in the room but us.

I'm just using logic
to connect some dots.

It's the best guess I've got.

But you're betting our lives
on it.

I'll cover that bet.
I get it.

Well, Morty, I think
you're doing that smirky face

because you're misinterpreting
the moment.

I am not being coy
about some hidden love for you.

I want to be really clear that
if anyone has a better guess,

like, if I gave you
an amulet last night or --

[DING]

- Phew.
-[ BOTH SIGH ]

[ GASPS ]

Oh, shit.

<i>Sorry. I'm...not good
at goodbyes,</i>

<i>and I'm drunk,
so, you know, I just...</i>

<i>It looks like I'm never
going to see you again.</i>

<i>I can't really roll
with the hero types.</i>

<i>And I don't -- They --
They don't want me around.</i>

<i>But I want you to know, even if
I didn't show it at the time,</i>

<i>I really appreciated
you sticking by me.</i>

<i>God damn it, why am I crying?
It makes no sense.</i>

<i>Ugh, you're</i> --
<i>you're probably confused</i>

<i>because we barely
knew each other,</i>

<i>but you really
stuck your neck out</i>

<i>[BURPS] when you gave me props
for my awesome jokes</i>

<i>in the briefing room.</i>

<i>Everybody else had their head
so far up their ass.</i>

<i>Even my own grandson is like,</i>

<i>"Oh, the Vindicators,
they're so cool."</i>

<i>I mean, he's a moron.
That's their demographic.</i>

<i>But you're different,
Noob Noob.</i>

Motherfucker.

<i>You're fucking cool.
And you're smart.</i>

<i>[ CRYING ] And I bet
we could've hung out and shit.</i>

<i>And I hope you get to be
a full-fledged Vindicator,</i>

<i>and -- and do -- do me a favor.</i>

<i>Don't -- Don't let them know
I-l got emotional.</i>

<i>But you can tell them
one thing.</i>

<i>Tell them I said</i> --

<i>Oh, fuck. Okay. I just
shit myself. Okay, later.</i>

- W-- Dude, Morty, what happened?
- Shut up.

I sense this means
we are not dying.

Not all of us.

-[ BOTH CHOKING]
- Sweetheart.

Just let Titty Bean do this,
Snuzzles.

It's for the greater good.

- Greater good?
- Titty Bean?

It's like you said, Morty.

- There's no right or wrong.
- Never said that.

It's the galaxy's faith
in the Vindicators

that keeps the galaxy secure.

Yeah, I feel safer already.

No doubt. Who do we make
the check out to?

I will say we are getting
some good licks in

-while choking to death --
- Right?

Titty Bean.
Listen to me.

When you came to me,

I was merely
a sentient colony of ants.

It was your beliefs,
your pursuit of justice

that taught me to be a man.

[GRUNTS]

When did it get so complicated?

Who knows?
But we can make it simple again.

You were always the romantic.

Which is why you can't leave,
either.

-[ SQUISH!]
[ GROANS ]

I'm sorry, my love.

Damn!
She double-crossed Snuzzles!

Silence!

And I'm pretty sure
we don't need Vindicators.

Don't mind if I do.

Which ones?
The rad ones,
that's which!

How are you kids?

Did you know your grandpa's
tryin' to get your attention?

Yeah, yeah,
screw off, weirdo.

Grandson,
w-w-what's that mean?

He's one of
those cult people.

They worship some psycho
named Roy

that says
he's everybody's grandpa.

So what do you want to do today,
e-eat some snacks

and maybe let me
kiss you finally?

Y'know,
with my mouth and stuff?

This is going on
right now.

L-Let's go check it out.
Aw, geez.

C-Come on, just for fun,
you know?

No, that's not what I'm --

You guys keep thinking
I'm a religious leader.

This isn't a religion.
This is actual truth.

I'm a scientist in real life,

but this isn't real life,
this is a video game.

Y-Y-You at least understand
that much, right?

This is a video game?

But you said
I'm your grandson?

I'm saying everyone is.

Everyone here,
everyone in this world but me.

You're all my grandson,
your name is Morty,

you're stuck in a video game,
and I'm here to get you out.

What about me?
Am I your grandson?

I just said everyone is!

-Wow!
-Incredible!

Okay, okay,
but don't react like that.

It's not a religion.
This is what is happening.

You and me and your sister
are at an arcade

called Blips and Chitz.

It's been taken over
by terrorists.

The power went out,
the game restarted,

and your identity
has been splintered

into all the non-player
characters.

So I jacked in as Roy,
that's the player character,

to get you, my grandson, Morty,

out of the game
before it's over and you die.

Okay, question over here.

Am I your grandson?
Jesus! Yes!

Every single one of you
is one five-billionth of Morty.

All of you,
collectively, are Morty.

Look, I-I don't wanna
seem impatient

but there's actually a lot more
that we have to get done

so if this is
how hard it's gonna be,

we are in a lot of trou--

Summer, what?!

I can't do this
if you keep bugging me!

Do you understand
time dilation?

I'm losing a month
a second out here.

There's an alien army
shooting people.

What am I doing?!

It's a small group of
alien terrorists.

Just do a "Die Hard."
What does that mean?

Sneak around, use air vents.
You've never seen "Die Hard"?

I'm 17. No, I've never
seen fucking "Die Hard"!

Well, neither did
the guy in "Die Hard,"

so you're nailing it!

- Sure.
- What the hell?!

You said you were
letting me choose.

Yeah, whether to
break my fucking heart.

You chose badly.

just another game.

everything changed.

I had gotten my first taste of
respect and my first voiceover.

there I wanted more of both.

Beth, Jerry, do
something fun with us.

A giant monster is attacking
in the Nibblenug system.

Your suits are in the bathroom.

Mine smells skeletony.

I have a chiropractor
appointment.

What are you involving us in?

Rick's been collecting
GoTron ferrets,

and now that he has all five,
we can combine them into --

Morty, for Christ's
sake spoilers.

Spoilers, Morty.

WE don't need to
sell this to anyone.

There's a giant
monster attacking.

In the Nibblenug system.

Since when does this
house care about alien lives.

We don't even watch
British television.

Told you. Let's just
get Gene from next door

- and a homeless guy.
- No. Hold on.

Fuck Gene. Fuck the homeless.

Your kids and their
grandpa are asking you to do

an activity with them.

When did that stop being
a parent's wettest dream?

I guess around the
time our family created

a giant incest baby,
and the government

launched it into space.

Oh my God, we made
a giant incest baby.

Oh my God, you might be a clone.

I exist because you
guys failed to abort me.

We get the family we
get, not the one we want.

And if you want to
keep the one you got,

get your asses into
some anime spacesuits.

- Fair enough.
- Okay.

- Good work, Summer Camp.
- Yeah.

I'm exci-toked about this.

Sure you are -- now.

and I was at the bottom of it.

- It's really all he had left.

Summer, hear you?

hear your voiceover.

Now, we --

Go, Team GoTron!

Where are we zip-lining through
futuristic metallic tunnels to?

Each robot ferret is at a
different location on Earth.

You're going to the
center of a volcano.

Thank you?

Okay, well, this isn't not fun.

Regroup on me.

I'll shoot a portal
to Nibblenug.

Did I just monorail from
my kitchen to Hawaii

just to regroup in outer
space above my kitchen?

- Uh, Summer?
- It's cool, Dad. Shut up.

Everybody, attack one at a time!

Is that the best way to --

Tee up something
awesome? Yes. Follow me.

Guys, we did our best,
but there's only one hope.

knock it around a little bit,

but trust me, we're still

How do we --Just hit buttons.

we're too big to fail.

was me, right?

Uppercut!

I can't believe I almost
went to the chiropractor!

I've been waiting
a long time for this.

Form Luminous Energy Sword!

That's your ass, Mamma Jamma.

we could do anything.

never quite everything.

That was nothing -- nothing
compared to what we can do.

There are infinite universes
where I still don't have all five ferrets.

Th-th-those versions
of me would do anything

to complete their collections.

Okay, but Rick, remember
what you told me to remind you?

Sometimes, enough is...

Sometimes, enough is enough.

Morty, what are you doing?

He gets obsessed, Summer -

When are you going
to find your shame?

- I have more.
- Grandpa just gave

everybody the high
point of their lives,

and before he did,
every single one of you

was trying to
talk him out of it.

Wait. Yeah.
Wha-wha-what the fuck!

Now, he says we can go
higher, and big surprise,

it's time to drag
him down again.

Well, I vote --No voting.

No debate. It's not a democracy.

It's a Rickpublic.
You're in or you're out.

Obviously, I'm in. I
never said I wasn't in.

Me, neither. Tell us
what we're doing next.

Uh, I want to put
together a cookout.

That's it? I was honestly
prepared to blow someone.

- Jerry.
- I said "prepared" and "someone."

No, the beach that's all sand.

Yes, the boob one!

Ugh, and Summer.

Hot Head Rick --

at the end of a meeting.

me and Grandpa Rick.

Now, don't get me wrong, C137,

we're happy for
your good fortune.

But we did not
travel to your universe

just to have it
rubbed in our faces.

Come on, Big Fat
Rick, you know your face

is too small to rub anything on.

My face is the
same size as yours.

Wow. Huh. Hold on.

I'll be damned.

You're so fat you're
an optical illusion.

Summer, give 'em the pitch.

We're offering to help
each of your families

complete their full GoTrons.

In exchange for
some concessions.

Ever since I was a
little boy in the slums,

I have dreamed of
having a complete GoTron.

But concessions?

I hope you mean the
kind from a counter.

I hope she means ice cream!

We'd like you to
relocate your families

to this universe, and
let me make some

modifications to the GoTrons --

in the interest of us
all working together.

Want to know what I think?

Sure, Hothead Rick, just don't
unexpectedly fly off the handle.

I think you guys got a lot of
nerve acting better than us!

This is the family that
made a giant incest baby!

Had the government
launch it into space!

It's still floatin' around
out there somewhere!

Are we ever gonna
live that down?

If I get a full GoTron, it
won't be by kissing your ass,

it'll be by taking
what's mine -- yours!

Hey! Gross! No need.

And you were
driving... a ferret?

We all are, moron! Give me key!

You'll regret this, you
level-headed fucks.

Obviously, we predicted
that might happen,

which is why we have
Yo-Yo Rick on standby.

Anybody got beef with Yo-Yo?

Some people think
he's lame, but to me,

he's lame in a cool
way because he owns it.

Cool. That concludes
business. Lil' Ricky Wrap it Up?

Raise 'em up, boys! Oh-pah!

Bitch! When are you gonna
stop breaking my balls?

You win, okay?

We're not competing, Morty.
And there's your answer.

I could move you up if I could
trust you to put family first.

H-how is that
putting family first?

Show me all the blueprints!
Show me all the blueprints!

I agree. That's an issue.

Big Fat Rick, his flask stays full

I know it feels good
when he likes you,

but that doesn't mean him
liking you makes you good.

Solid babble, Morty -- like a

Yeah, I'm not as smart as you.

That's why I know
you know what I mean.

You mean, if I really
loved my family,

I'd give control of it
back to your jealous ass.

Now? I don't think --

Okay, I'll do it. God damn.

the night Summer realized

Okay, I've got 90 extra ferrets,
which means I need 10 more,

and then four of you
get your own GoGoTron,

and 20%of you get a GoTron,

'cause we're all gonna
have a fucking GoGoGoTron.

He's very excited. Um...

Oh-pah!

I hate my family.

You should.

Get in.

How's it going with your
grandpa's compulsiveness?

Is your sister still
enabling it? Huh?

Who are you people?

Let's just say we're the
rightful owners of these ferrets.

Then, why were they scattered,
and buried across the universe?

We mean in a more
general, cultural sense. Arrrgh!

What your Grandpa did
is called "appropriation."

Not cool! Hunnnnngh!

Look, Morty, we've
been watching.

We know you're the one
that knows what's best.

Work with us from the inside.

Help us take over
this operation.

We're literally designed
for it. Mm-hmmmmmm!

Nobody will know it was you.

Then, you can get
back to what's important.

Are those Boob Bucks?

Legal tender at every
kiosk and ride! Huuunh!

I can't.

Summer's treating me like
shit, but she's still my sister.

That's really noble, Morty.

If you were in our family,
your loyalty would be rewarded.

But you're not in our family,
which means we can kill you.

Oh, yeah?

when I stuck my neck out

stomped on anyway.

- Dad!
- Mom! Dad!

Hothead Rick, baby!

I set myself up for that!

- What the hell happened?!
- Hothead Rick.

How did he get so close to us?

Morty was supposed
to be security!

- Morty?
- I-I-I stepped away, alright?

But-but not to let that happen!

Morty, we're not
attractive strangers

next to you on
a flight to Paris,

traveling alone to
get over a breakup,

so this is no time to be coy!

- Oh... pah.
- Lil' Ricky.

I'm all wrapped up, Summer.

Guys, I know you don't trust
me, but what have we become?

Why are we doing this anymore?

Because it's
fun, you little rat.

Now go home, and
play video games

while we clean up these bodies,

or your mother and I will hire
people to break your knees!

This is $16,000 we
got from the deep state

for stepping on
that trailer park.

That should be enough for
school lunch and home repairs.

Now, I gotta turn
my back on you.

No!

way, things were looking up.

Hi, Summer. Um, my
cockpit's not getting Wi-Fi.

Dad, you know that's
not what I do around here.

Oh, I'm not your Dad.
I'm a version of him.

This is my first day here,

and I-I'm not sure what
you do around here.

- Then fuck off.
- Oh, fuck you.

Excuse me? I want your ID.

Mom. Are you Mom? Can
you control your rookie Jerrys.

Sweetie, we're all a
little overwhelmed -

Good point. You're
not a war-time Mom.

Why don't you find
your version of Dad,

and take a break,
take a holiday.

I don't have time to
wait for your confirmation,

so let's just say, if
you're here in 10 minutes,

I'll have you removed.

And then, the GoTrons

make the GoTrons,
make the GoTrons.

Couple of snags, but I
know how to speed things up.

Remember when we talked about
how the best thing we could do

for the family is to
recruit outside the family?

Yes. Way ahead of you.

Summer, I want
you to meet Kendra.

She's from a temp agency.

She's got an entire
workforce ready to go,

and all of them have previous
giant robot pilot experience.

So, we'll be ready to
go ahead of schedule.

Well, I don't know
about that but --

Well, Kendra knows. So...

So...

You here to break my legs?

No. We're here to talk
shit about your sister,

because she just fired us.

- You're kidding.
- Arrogant little bitch.

- Should we clip her?
- No. She's not worth doing time.

You wouldn't do time. You
brought her into the world.

So, I can take her out.

You thought there
was an actual law?

It's a joke mothers say.

What kind of fucked up
world have you been living in?

Uh, one where your
mother murdering you

isn't a comedic premise?

Guys, there's a little
adjustment period,

but pretty soon, you're
gonna to return to normal,

and you're not going
to want to kill Summer.

You're not even
gonna be mad at her.

Nah, fuck her. She's my enemy.

Should we kill ourselves, so
we can get to hell before her,

and hide near the entrance?

I like that.

Rick fired me.

I'm sorry.

Are you okay, baby?
What happened to us?

We lost our minds.

I did it. Morty was right.

I got addicted to
making Grandpa happy.

It's only because your Grandpa

inflates the value
of his happiness.

That's a good point.
I mean, look at me.

I'm easy to make
happy, which is why

nobody gives a shit if I am.

I appreciate it, but
there's something else too.

I've been really sensitive
about family lately

because of something
I've been keeping secret.

Okay. Who's on
the Supreme Court,

and what state do we live in?

It's been years since
I've thought about this.

No, I'm not pregnant.

But as you guys recall, and as
a lot of people keep bringing up,

Morty and I did accidentally
create a giant incest baby,

which the government
did launch into space.

And I'm not sure
how to tell you this,

but it is still alive, and I
have been in contact with it.

There were soldiers waiting
for me outside school last month.

They took me to the
Pentagon, and briefed me.

And from there, I was shuttled
to a secret base on Mars.

They had captured
him, and wanted to see

if he'd respond to me,
instinctively, being his mother.

And he sure did.

But what they didn't expect
was that I'd respond to him.

I was supposed to
help discipline him,

so they could turn him
into the ultimate weapon.

Instead, I trained him to
love, to believe in himself,

and finally, to escape.

The government doesn't want
anyone to know it happened,

but it's only a matter of time
before the story comes out.

And when it does, all we're
going to have is each other.

And you guys are a
couple, and Rick has Morty,

but I'm the odd one out

So, I wanted to make
sure we stuck together.

But instead, I drove us
apart, and Rick replaced me

with an anime girl,
so all I've got is myself

and my giant, tortured,
MORTY: [ GROANS ]

[ CAR ALARM CHIRPS ]

[ ENGINE REVS, STUDENTS SCREAM ]

[ ALARM BLARING, HORN HONKING ]

Oh, my god!

Did you get any of that?

It's a good show!

What is on Jessica's
Instagram again.

Get out of here, jerk!

What's so embarrassing,
Morty?

Sharing it with your family
might help.

Summer, stop shaming
your brother.

Morty, stop being a creepy,
perverted cyberstalker.

I'm not cyberstalking!

I-I-I just wanted to know where
she got this necklace from.

And now I know.

Her -- Her -- Her grandma
left it to her.

You're quiet, Rick.

Shouldn't you be revealing
grandmas aren't real?

Hi. I've placed an auto-response
chip in my brain

so I can spend time
with my family.

But you arespending time
with your family.

Thank you
for talking to Rick.

Alright, I'm finished
with my breakfast

and my Amazon wish list.
Let's go, Morty.

I need death crystals
from Forbodulon Prime.

Uh...

Dad?
There's a way we do this now.

Morty, would you please
accompany me

to Forbodulon Prime
for death crystals?

Well, thank you for asking.
Yes, I will do that.

It isa hot photo.

I think grief
flushes your cheeks.

Dad, you hardly put
any syrup on.

Honey, stop raising
your father's cholesterol

so you can take
a hot funeral selfie.

I never get to do
anything.

Uh, Rick,
maybe if we go a little --

Faster?
Good idea, Morty.

It'll get us through these
asteroids sooner.

Geez, you're really thispissed
about my mom making sure

I'm okay
with our adventures?

What's next, Morty?
What if I want you to jump off

- the Empire State Building? I have to ask?
- Yes?

And you seriously don't see how
that's a slippery slope?

Just shut up and help me
with these, please.

Why are they called
death crystals?

D-Do they kill you?

You're thinking of bullets,
Morty.

Death crystals show you
how you're gonna die.

Jesus Christ!
I-I die a million times?

Your future stems from
your present,

which, if you're living right,
keeps changing.

Truth is, anyone that knows how
they're definitely gonna die

is either boring as hell
or about to get shot.

Duck!

Who are those guys?!

Crystal poachers.

There's no lower form
of life.

They think the galaxy's
their own personal piggy bank.

Wait, then what are we?

We're Rick and Morty.

You're about to witness the only
real use for these crystals.

They show you when
the other guy's reloading.

Certain death, certain death,
certain death, uncertain death.

And certain death,
certain death, certain death.

Definitely gonna get shot
by this guy;

this is totally my fate;
nothing I could possibly do;

okay, now,
not so much.

Help me gather these up.

You just use these
to win fights? Idon't use them.

People that spend their life
avoiding death are already dead.

They're also rich, and I like to
spend my life with their money.

Oh, my God. Morty!

Jessica!
Oh!

I love you.

Oh! Whoa! Whoa!

Morty.Oh! Oh! Oh!

I love you.

Jessica.
I want to die with Jessica.

Ahh!
What are you doing?

Oh, um, c-can I drive?
Why?

The...feel of the open road?

Alright!
Who's this grandson?

I like his style.

- Morty, you know outer space is up, right?
- Yeah, yeah.

I'm just, uh,
following...my...instincts.

Will you just go up?
Stop!

You're gonna make me
die wrong!Wait a minute, what?

Morty, do you have
a death crystal in your pocket?

No! Maybe!
You little monster!

I thought you were
masturbating!

And you took that
in stride?!

You'd rather
I address it?!

Why would I be doing it?!

Why would you steal
a death crystal?!

I want to die old!

Then stop driving!

No!
You son of a bitch!

Give me the wheel, Morty.

Goddamn it.

Ohhh, shit.

Oh, shit, oh, shit,
oh, shit, oh, shit.

I love you, Morty.

I will avenge my death.

Holy shit!
Just kidding.

I'm a crisis detection
and correction hologram

generated by a chip that
"real" Rick put in your spine.

"Real" in quotes because calling
density-privileged entities

"real"
is incredibly holo-phobic.

Morty, do me a solid --
problematic wordplay aside --

grab the gun with the blue
handle from the trunk

and get a tissue sample
from the corpse.

Alright, now
take that to the trunk

and insert it
into the clone compiler.

I see you appear to be holding
a death crystal

that's guiding your decisions
more than I am.

That's your right.

I just want to remind you that
some people can't hold anything

and can never die, so that's
a little offensive to --

Oh, okay.

Listen, I'm programmed
for tolerance, Morty.

So I'm willing to accept
that you're doing this

if you're willing to accept
that you need to stop.

Accepting.
Rerouted.

Backup. Data.
Operation. Phoenix. Initiated.

What the hell?
I axed this protocol.

What are you doing
with my clone?

It's okay. I'm you.

I took my own clone vat offline
a couple seasons ago,

so I think my backup got
rerouted to your universe.

I'm sorry. All good.
Happy to help.

By the way, annoying
that I even have to ask,

but you are down with
fascist dystopias, right?

YYYYYes.

That "yes" was pretty...

...liberal
with the letter "Y."

Well, isn't this strange.

I trust, the kind of strange
that makes Rick and Morty...

...stronger.

Morty, I caught this socialist
in my bathrobe.

He wants to give
all of our martinis

to a family
of immigrants.

Obviously,
the most likely imposter

is the wet, naked clone.It is obvious.

But it won't be
to the police.

Ohh!
'Kay.

He was an inferior Rick.
He was too political.

I want to have fun, classic
Rick-and-Morty adventures

like in the old days.

Then we'll get along fine,
Fascist Morty.

For starters, I just need to get
to Forbodulon Prime --

You will go
where I want you to go!!

Fuck.

Hey, hey! Ho, ho!

Not cloning your grandpa
has got to go!

Hey, hey! Ho, ho!

Not cloning your grandpa
has got to go!

You don't get out of my face,
I'm gonna flush Rick's DNA.

Alright.
Okay, regroup, everybody.

You, too, Berkeley!

Snap out of it.

At least tell me
what this death is

that you're
so determined to...

Oh. Jessica.

Morty, I love --

What?! No, no!
No, no, no!

I love you.

Damn it!

How am I gonna die with her
if I can't even talk to her?

Here's an idea, Morty.
Throw that thing in the garbage,

stop planning your own death,
and talk to whoever you want.

Now you just sound
like Real Rick.

You're better than
that language, Morty.

I ain't better than shit,
Jack.

So, uh,
w-what are we doing?

Stop asking questions.
Stop doing meta-commentary.

Just have fun.

We're going on a simple,
fun, classic adventure.

Okay, you know what?
It would really help

if you could just say anything
other than what you don't want.

I like Mr. Meeseeks.

Okay, now we're talking.
You know what?

I usually keep a Meeseeks box
in my glove compartment,

so maybe Fascist Rick
does, too.

Ah!
Well, look at that.

Now we're doing something
we've done before.

I'm Mr. Meeseeks!

Kill this Nazi prick!

Can do!

- Come here, you son of a bitch!
- No! Stop!

Accepting. Rerouted.

Backup. Data.
Operation. Phoenix. Initiated.

Aw, come on, man.

Whoa, are you okay?

Yeah, sorry.

I'm a Rick
from another reality.

I-I got uploaded
to your clone vat.

Hey, don't worry about it, man.
I have a dozen.

W-W-What the heck,
Rick?

Are you making clones
down here?

Get outta here, Morty!

Stop asking
stupid questions, Morty!

You sound like a piece of shit.

Aw, geez.

So, tell the truth, man.
No shame.

You're looking at
your shrimp body like "What?!"

Ah, is it that obvious?
I'm sorry.

Yeah, my original body is more
bipedal -- uh, ape-descended.

Really! Weird.

Does your house look
like a tree, or...

No, it looks like this.

It's, like, identical
to this, actually.

That is such a mindfuck.

It's all good, man.
I'm fine with it.

Honestly, you're doing me
a huge favor

by being shrimp
instead of fascists.

What?

Goddamn it!

When did this shit become
the default?!

Who wants to come up
to the board

and show me
some basic-ass integers?

- I love you, Morty.
- Aah!

Morty?
Yeah, right.

That's not an integer!

Apparently,
it doesn't matter.

Damn, Morty,
you're bad at math,

but I'm giving you
an A-plus in confidence.

Just doin'
what I gotta do.

Extra credit!

I love you, Morty.
I love you, Morty.

What's with the strut?

You think you own this school?
- Nope!

What if I killed you?
Would you be strutting then?

Only if the events of the Pixar
movie "Coco" are to be believed,

which I doubt.

I have it on good authority

that you're probably
not gonna kill me.

So why don't you do
what I do

and just go with the flow,
nice and Zen, baby.

Aah! Ugh! Ugh! Ugh!

Ugh! Impotence!

Aah! Impotent rage!

Ugh! Ugh! Ugh!

You die tomorrow,
no matter what.

It's what bullies call
a "fait accompli."

Oh, man! Oh, well, well, well. Mm.

Looks like you got yourself in
a lick of trouble, huh, Morty?

Okay, okay, look,
if you help me not die,

I'll bring Rick
back to life.

Why are you pretending
to eat chicken?

Excuse me?

This chicken is
quite real to me.

Yeah, okay,
but it doesn't have --

Nutrients?
Yeah.

What's the last thing
you ate?

Baloney and an orange.

So, no holographic foods?

So, to me, you never ate?

Or we could try
respecting each other.

Will you just show me
how to stay alive?

Alright, Morty, a deal's a deal.

Once we bring your Rick
back to life,

then I'll help you
with the bully.

Go ahead and open the hatch
to the subterranean lab.

That's where all
the cloning equipment is.

Please tell me you're not
hitting that crystal again.

Look, Rick might be the epitome
of bloated flesh privilege,

but he's right
about one thing.

You're gonna be a lot happier
if you focus on the moment,

rather than on
how you're gonna die.

I mean, w-who's worried
about that, huh?

Sorry, Hologram Rick.

I'm going with the crystal
on this one.

Morty.

Oh, alright, okay.

Just because I can't interact
with solid matter

means you can just
walk all over me?

Dear God.

Bist du faschistisch?

Nope.

Finally.

I thought maybe you were
pussying out.

Hyah!

What the fuck?

Oh, the air's getting thin!

Well, well, well, looks like
there's a new bully in town!

Lucky for us, he just made
bully-bullying the new bullying!

Bully him!

Aah!

We've got an Akira-type
situation going on

behind the mall.
Over.

Dying with Jessica...

Hey!

What the hell?

Aah! Aah!

I'm Mr. Meeseeks!
Look at me!

Shield me from the law!

- Yes, sir! Can do!
- Stand down!

Look at me!

I...will...die...old!

Up next, an unstoppable
science-fiction boy

is attacking our nation's
final line of defense.

Will we all fall
to his deadly touch?

But first, something silly?

What do you mean,
"but first"?

I already said "up next."
You always do this.

I don't alwaysdo shit.
Don't gaslight me.

Gaslighting doesn't exist.

You made it up
'cause you're fucking crazy.

Why are you letting me
do this?

I do as the crystal guides.

Your Honor, my client was acting
in self-defense.

He turned 13 men
into piles of ash.

Sit down!
Before I sentence you,

is there anything
you have to say for yourself?

I...w-w-will a-al-sways --

always r-r-remember
o-our --

our -- our...v-v-t-time --
time...

i-in...f-g-g-g-P-P-Peru.

I will always remember our time
in Peru, Your Honor.

Your Honor,

as you can see, my client
is speaking nonsense.

Stop.

Those were my husband's
last words.

He says that he...l-loves you...

ttt-llll-lit-lit-little --
little

ff-gg-sp-spa-ffggarrow --

sparrow!

He loves you,
little sparrow.

He's innocent.
Case dismissed.

I'm coming for you,
Condor!

Well, I, for one, will not be
accepting this verdict.

And this little monster may
think he's gotten away,

but there is something called
the court of public opinion

that still has final say
in this country.

Oh, I guess he's coming out
of the courthouse now.

Let's go live to that.

People, I gotta tell you
something.

That little boy...

I thought I knew everything
about everything.

But something about the tones
and frequencies

that just came out of his mouth
have made me...

I mean, I think we're just about
ready to forgive him

and move past this whole thing.
He's a free young man.

And as far as continuity goes,
the reset button's been hit.

Morty!
That was a fast trial.

Jess-i-ca?

A bunch of us girls were gonna
go skinny-dipping later,

if you wanted to join.

Actually, now, really.
We're gonna do it right now.

This is the last conversation
I'm having about it

fully clothed.

No, thanks.

I'm...assuming...
we...maybe...

get together...
in our 40s?

Uh, cool.

Sounds...hot.

Bye.

Must...continue...
moving...

in ways...that lead...
to dying...with you.

Whoa!
Way to use up a clone!

What the fuck, man?

What's the matter with you?
Y-Y-You don't talk?

Tarantula
got your tongue?

Uh...
Heil, Wasp Hitler?

What?
What the fuck?

Where's that shit
coming from?

Look, I'm a primate.
I-I'm having a hard time.

I'll think or say
whatever gets me home.

Well, here's how it works
with wasps.

We eat our prey alive,
and when we don't,

we lay our eggs
in their eyeballs

so that our young can feast
on their brains

when they hatch.

I do keep rolling out
the hits, don't I?

[BANG]

Oh!
It's the Magic Crayon Lady!

Are you hungry?
I was just about to make dinner.

And by "make dinner," I mean --

Tommy, I'm going to take you
to the real world.

Well, this <i>is</i> the real world.

No, you don't understand!
Your dad --

Uh, people think
your dad ate you!

So?

People should eat people.

Just leave me alone!

Tommy, you don't understand.

I have to make this right

because it's my fault
that you're in here.

- I'm Beth.
-[ ALL GASP]

Beth?
The destroyer!

Oh, suck it up,
Princess Incest.

You fell into some honey.

Well, it tends to happen
when one is pushed into honey.

I respect your right
to believe I pushed you.

Oh, do I get to have that?

Is my reality like
a little side of fries --

a little Kwanzaa
you're willing to slide my way?

Yes, because I'm focused
on saving your father's life

because I'm not
a petty piece of shit.

So, then,
it should be pretty easy

to say, "Sorry I pushed you."

Real easy and not necessary,

since you coming home
will save your dad's life

whereas nothing is changed

by anyone stroking
your batshit-crazy ego.

Sorry, forgive me.

Uh, I've been in Froopyland
for quite a while.

Have apologies changed?

Tommy, I'm sorry you think
you deserve an apology.

Oh, my God.
I'm my father.

Uh, will someone
just kill this B-word?

[ FROOPYS MUTTERING
THREATENINGLY]

[GRUNTS]
Hi-ya!

Oh, my God.
I'm my father!

- Ya!
-Ooh! Froopy'

[SCREAMS]

- SWITCHBLADE: Born to stab!
- TOGETHER: Ooh!

And that's why one pussy
plus two pussies

makes a bunch of pussies.

Come on, y'all,
I'm trying to make this

appealing to your
sex-addicted lifestyles.

Hi. I need to pull Morty out of
school. Come on, Morty.

Ha! You heard
your daddy, Morty.

You have to leave school.

Wait, what are my values?

- Dad, what's going on?
- We're going to Alaska.

- What? Why?
- It's nice there.

Also, I broke up with Kiara,
and she didn't take it well,

and she wants to murder you two.

What? Th-Then why
are we walking?

I'm walking because I'm tired.

You guys should definitely run.

-[ WHOOSH ]
-[ SCREAMS]

-[ THUD ]
- Excuse me, I just --

You know what?
I'm -- I'm just gonna go left.

No, okay, your left,
that's fine.

Do you know what left is,
'cause -- Ugh!

What does your breakup
have to do with us?

Yeah, we chose Mom hands down.

I thought we made that clear
at the lawyer's office

and in the comments under
your weird rant on Facebook.

-[ CRASH ]
-[ TIRES SQUEAL]

She kind of blames you guys
for the breakup.

- Why?
- Why?

Because I told her
it was your fault.

- What?!
- What?!

Look, I'm not an evil person.

I'm just not very imaginative!

Cool.

Dad?

I feel like I've spent my life

pretending you're a great guy
and trying to be like you.

And the ugly truth
has always been --

That I'm not that great a guy
and you're exactly like me.

Am I evil?

Worse.
You're smart.

When you know nothing matters,
the universe is yours.

And I've never met a universe
that was into it.

The universe is
basically an animal.

It grazes on the ordinary.

It creates infinite idiots
just to eat them,

-not unlike your friend Timmy.
- Tommy.

Yeah, it hardly matters now,
sweetie.

You know, smart people get
a chance to climb on top,

take reality for a ride,

but it'll never stop
trying to throw you.

And, eventually, it will.

There's no other way off.

Dad, I'm out of excuses
to not be who I am.

So who am I?
What do I do?

My advice -- Take off.

Put a saddle on your universe.
Let it kick itself out.

I can't do that.

The kids, Jerry, my job,

and, as much as I hate to admit
it, ABC's "The Bachelor."

I can make a clone of you,
a perfect instance of you,

with all your memories,
an exact copy in every way.

It'll love and provide
for the kids,

do your job, and consume
broadcast-network reality TV

on the same allegedly ironic
level as you.

You could be gone a day, a week,

or the rest of your life
with zero consequences.

The moment you decide
to come back,

I flip a switch,
and the clone's job is done.

It feels no pain,
it regrets nothing,

and has zero chance
of going "Blade Runner."

If nothing matters,
why would you do that for me?

I don't know, maybe you matter
so little that I like you.

Or maybe it makes you matter.

Maybe I love you.

Maybe something about
your mother.

Don't jump a gift shark
in the mouth.

I don't know if I can do it.

Then stay
and luxuriate in a life

you can finally know
you've chosen.

My secret bonus is that
no matter what you choose,

you're finally gonna
chill the fuck out.

Okay.

I know what I want to do.

[WHOOSH ]

Aah!

'[ THUD ]
-Ow!

You can't run forever!

SUMMER:
She's really pissed off.

JERRY: I know.
It's kinda hot.

Shut up!

The hunters!
They're back! Run!

- We're not hunters.
- We want to hide with you.

We're not hiding.
We're nesting.

Ooh la la.

[ALL SCREAM ]

The children must be destroyed
so that we can be together.

You need to break up with her,
Dad -- properly!

-[ WHOOSH ]
- God damn it, Dad!

[GRUNTS]
Dump her!

Okay, okay.

Kiara, let's just run away.

- Dad!
- Come on!

Just rip the Band-Aid off!

Okay!

Kiara, when I told you
my kids were bigoted racists

who were demanding
I break up with you, I lied.

If anybody deserves to be
telekinetically strangled,

it's me.

I'm the one who
wants to break up.

I -- I'm not an evil person.

I'm lazy, I'm cowardly,

and -- and I do not
know what I'm doing.

Look, I got someone pregnant
at 17.

We're getting a divorce.
None of this is on purpose.

I was excited
to date someone cool

because it would make
my ex notice me.

I would expect nothing less
from humanity --

a selfish, manipulative,
dishonest species that --

- Kiara?
- Trandor!

What are you doing here?

Just... hunting.

Do you really expect me
to believe

it has nothing to do with us?

You knew Earth was my domain.

I don't like what
you're insinuating.

- Dad, can we go now?
- Hold on a second.

I'm starting to get the feeling
that <i>I</i> was the rebound.

Dad, you just got handed
an ex machina.

You're taking it.

Varrix nests spread
across 300 galaxies,

and you just happened to pick
this planet to hunt?

That's Gorgon shit --
total Gorgon shit!

[BIRDS CHIRPING]

We're home!

- Hey, guys!
- What's for dinner?

- How was Jerry's?
- The usual.

- Can we have pizza?
- Pizza sounds great.

Hey, Rick, did you know my dad
was dating an alien?

No. Gross.
For the alien.

Aw, crap, I think
Arnaldo's is closed.

Are you guys sure
you want pizza?

[WHOOSH ]

Arnaldo's isn't closed
in the dimension

where they didn't invent
Daylight Savings!

What would we do without you?
I love you, Dad.

Love you, too, sweetie.

By the way,
that wasn't time travel.

There were just a couple pizzas
on the counter.

I grabbed them.

Oh, my God.

Holy shit.
Oh.

What are --
What are these things?!

Do I look like I know?

Last thing I remember, I was,
ugh, in a cave

looking at some wet egg and --
Oh, that probably did it.

I told you not to look
at that egg!

I-It was too wet.

You don't get to tell me
what to look at.

I've seen
your Pornhub account.

Also, who makes
a Pornhub account?

The algorithm learns your
preferences better that way.

Plus if you get in kind
of a cool enough relationship,

you can sort
of follow each other

and check out
each other's kinks, you know?

Alright, God damn, sold.

How do we get out of here?Morty, relax.

They're face-hugging
parasites.

I don't think their society's
gonna be that hard to navigate.

Okay, yeah, this might be
a little harder than I thought.

Holy shit.
They've got an M&M's store.

This is bad, Rick.
Th-Th-Th-Th-This is really bad.

Just be cool, Morty.

All we gotta do is blend in,
find our ship,

and get
the fuck outta here.

Alright, Morty, here's the plan,
put this back on your face.

- I-I'm not putting that back on my face!
- Relax. It's dead.

Okay, now it's dead.

Come on, hurry up.

Rick, i-it's bleeding.

I-It's bleeding acid.

Alright, well, that should
be the last of it.

If not, then just gimme
two tugs on the arm.

Seems like a self-destructive
life cycle.

Is that gonna
happen to us?

You feel an egg
in your stomach?

- No.
- Well, glass half full.

How's it going?
'Sup.

- Glory to Glorzo.
- Totally.

Love Glorzo.

Glorzo is peace.

Peace is Glorzo.

Wow, just cogs in the machine,
y'know?

Ma-Makes you think --Yeah, I'm sure you'll make this

into a beautiful short film
that your parents'll pay for,

Morty, but right now, we really
just need to find my ship.

You sure you're not
just jealous?

Looks like I'm kind of
a celebrity around here.

The future is Glorzo!

Oh, my God.
I was just reading you.

Congratulations on making it
into print media.

Real bright future there.

Honestly, it's shocking to see
the two of you together.

Because we're both
geniuses?

No, because I've seen
your videos,

and you make me
fucking sick.

Fix him.

Glory to Glorzo.

Sir, you shouldn't
wander off like that.

We've been looking
all over for you.

The project is ready
for your approval.

Sir, is this man
bothering you?

Um, no, h-he's fine.

Uh, what -- what project?

Jesus Christ,
who the fuck was I?

Here's a scientific fact
I'm not allowed to say --

Our hosts are biologically
designed to incubate our eggs.

If that "triggers" you,
fuck off.

If it doesn't,
please like and subscribe.

New videos every Glorzday.

God,
was I at least rich?

I mean, d-d-did
I at least sell out

and sell vitamins
or something?

Rick, I've watched enough
Pornhub to know

what a studio apartment
looks like.

God damn.

Jesus, your Glorzo got
shit done.

My lord,
we await your command.

Oh, to...

shoot it?
A-At people?

Glorzo is peace.

All shall be made Glorzo.

Glory to Glorzo.

I... did this?

You and the amazing technology
you both brought us.

Yeah, makes sense.

A-And where
was this heading?

Earth?
Probably Earth?

The humans
call it "Earth."

Yeah, well, okay,
first of all, great work.

You guys obviously put a lot
of work into this.

Okay.And y'know, it shows.

I-It really shows.
But um...

I-I've been thinking,
and, you know,

maybe we should
just call this off.

Sorry,
is -- is there more?

Nope, nope.

I-I guess, uh, that --
that's it.

Just don't Glorzo Earth.

Just would've been nice
to have heard this sooner

before we spent
all day on it.

Yeah, well, I-I'm just hearing
about it, too.

You ordered it.
Right.

I-I did, and, um...

I'm just saying for next time,
maybe put more thought

into it
before a whole day of --

Okay, well, I'm sorry I made you
do your job for a fucking day!

You look like you were
all really busy

before I came
and fucked it all up.

Boy, oh boy, huh?
This guy's a genius, but at --

but at what price,
you know?

Y'know, fuck you,
Rick!

Who's...Rick?

Yeah, well, if we're free
to ask questions,

why haven't you blinked,
uh, for 20 minutes,

and why, uh, doesn't
your mouth move when you talk?

Ah, geez, look at me.

I-I feel down on --
on -- on the floor.

Oh, let -- let me, uh, help --
help you out here, buddy.

Ah, thanks, man.
Thanks, pal. That's right.

I'm right back where -- where --
right back in the saddle here.

Alright,
fuck it, run.

I-I hate this!
I hate all of this!

W-W-We're gonna
get purged, Morty.

Help me up.

Oh, geez, geez!
Wait a minute, Rick.

Why don't we just use
your portal gun?

It's in the car, dip-ass.

[ GRUNTS ] Oh, god, it hurts.

She got me right in
the goddamn liver, Morty.

It's the hardest-working liver
in the galaxy, Morty,

and now it has a hole in it.
I hope it was worth it.

I was just trying to do right.

Yeah, well, that's not really
the theme of tonight's party.

Heads up. Rapists.

Well, don't just stand there,
Morty.

- Purge 'em.
- Me?

No, me. Should I rub
my liver hole on them?

Pick up a stick or something
and kill them.

- Um, w-we come in peace.
- [ SCREAMING ]

Oh, my god. [ GRUNTS ]

There's more
where that came from!

You want to get purged,
you bring it!

Drop [BELCHES] drop your shit!
Drop it all.

Morty, go get their shit.
Hurry up.

I only had one
of those things I threw.

I'm holding a box of Tic Tacs
right now.

- Want some crackers?
- No, thank you.

Are you ready to be nice to me?

In exchange for crackers?

- What happened to you?
- Dad, get a job.

You're trying to create drama
because you're bored.

Oh. [ BEEPING, WHIRRING ]

It's the space phone
Grandpa gave us.

- Hello?
- Hey, Summer, it's Grandpa.

I need you to do me a favor.

- I can barely hear you.
- Who is it?

Morty and I are on a planet
that's purging.

- I need you to take down...
- A plan that's what?

We're on a planet
that's purging, Summer. Purging.

We lost our car and my gun,
and we're in a purge.

- Ooh, is it Taddi Mason?
- Like the movie "The Purge"?

Yes, I-I need you to take...

- That movie sucked.
- Oh, my god. Hold on.

It's not Taddi Mason?

Dad, who the fuck
is Taddi Mason?

- My friend.
- Aah!

Are you okay?
I'm putting you on speaker.

- Taddi?
- Yes, Jerry, it's Taddi,

a person no one's ever heard of
until now,

calling you on a space phone.

JERRY: I can't tell
if you're being sarcastic.

[ GROWLS ]

Aah!

[ GROWLING ]

[ GUNSHOTS ] Reload, fast.

Summer, w-we need you
to take down this number.

- Quit screwing around.
- Morty? Are you all right?

- No!
- Why are you with Taddi Mason?

Holy shit Dad! Shut the fuck up!

Okay. I guess I'm just this
entire family's toilet paper.

Are you writing this down?
Will you please write this down?

- SUMMER: Yes, yes.
- 7-7-1-9-8...

- [ GROWLING ]
- 3-6-4-2-1-1-2-5.

Aah!

[ GROWLING ]

You son of a bitch!

Morty, I don't want to be
the "a little help" guy,

but a little help?

- Aah!
- Okay, I have a pen. Go.

7-7-1-9-8-3-6-4-2-1-1-2-5.

A spoon, Morty?

- A spoon?!
- I'm sorry.

There's a pile of silverware
next to you,

and you throw me the one thing
that can never kill anything?

All right, okay!

Summer, on the shelf above
my workbench in the garage,

there's a red box
with a keypad on it.

You're gonna
take that box outside,

and you're gonna type the number
I just gave you into the keypad.

- Got it?
- Got it.

Is it just part of growing up
to hate your dad?

I'm ignoring you.

Morty, if I can get to the top
of that lighthouse,

I can send the beacon, and your
sister can launch our package.

Just remember,
if there's people in there

and they try to purge us,
we got to purge them first.

We're not purging anyone, Rick,
all right? W-Will you stop it?

Morty, if we're gonna
survive tonight,

you're gonna need to harness
your repressed rage.

I don't have any!

Spoken like a person
with repressed rage.

[ DOORBELL RINGS ]

I take no part in the festival.

If you desire to kill me,
I only ask you do it quickly.

No such agenda, chief.

We're not too keen on the purge,
either, sir.

We were just hoping to get
on the roof of your lighthouse

so we can send a beacon
to my sister on Earth.

- It's a different planet.
- By the way,

life on other planets exists.
Don't let it distract you.

I'll let you use my lighthouse
for shelter and beacon-sending

on the condition that you listen
to my tale.

- Okay.
- Deal.

All right, I'm gonna go
to the roof and set things up.

- Morty, you listen to his tale.
- Okay.

[ CLEARS THROAT ]

"Fade in. Exterior.
Unnamed city. Day."

The hustle and bustle
is a symphony of progress.

We pan past windows, each of
which contain a different story,

to find Jacey Lakims, 28...
Hot, but doesn't know it.

Jacey stops
when her high heel gets caught

in the grating of a sewer.

Suddenly, a man steps into frame
and points a gun at her.

This is not her day.

Fade to black.

Title... 'three weeks earlier."'

[ SIGHS ] You really don't want
to talk to me about this.

Dad, Grandpa and Morty
are in danger.

You're unemployed,
and you're bored.

- They're a higher priority.
- Stop saying I'm unemployed!

Okay, 7-7-19-.8... 364... 2-1-
- 2... Aah!
- Good lord! Now what?

[ WHIRRING, HUMMING ]

Look, I'm your father, and
I love you is all I'm saying.

- I'll leave it at that.
- Fine, dad!

[ BOTH SCREAM ]

Oh, he might have said
to take it outside.

RICK: Come on, Summer.

How hard is it
to type some numbers into a box?

Target locked. [ DEVICE BEEPS ]

Oh, thank god.

Well, I did my job.
Summer did her job.

Now all Morty has to do is
finish listening to that tale.

BLANE: Maybe I don't need
a new friend.

JACEY: Maybe you're
the only friend I need.

BLANE: Need, or want?

JACEY: I've never been much
for wanting.

BLANE: Spoken like someone
with needs.

- Oh, geez.
- Hmm?

Uh, sorry. K-Keep going.

"Jacey reaches out
and touches his face."

It's clear he needs
what she wants.

She's a woman. He's a man.

The city burns in the background
as he takes her in his arms.

Fade out.

Title... 'The End'...

"question mark."

- Wow.
- Yeah?

It's... G-Good job. Good job.

- You liked it?
- Of course I did.

You didn't laugh
at the scene in the bar.

I... thought it was funny,
but I wanted to hear the rest.

Do you have any thoughts? Notes?

No. I-I just enjoyed it.

That's my note, you know?
Please write more.

- Seems a little insincere.
- What? No.

You don't have
to mollycoddle me.

I want to improve my writing.
Tell me your real thoughts.

All right. Well, um,
I'm not a huge fan, personally,

of the whole "three weeks
earlier" teaser thing.

I feel like, you know,

we should start our stories
where they begin

not start them
where they get interest...

- Get out.
- Um, what?

No, I'm sick of this.
You bang on my door,

you beg me to help you, I share
something personal with you,

and you take a giant shit on it.

Hey, man, we asked
if we could put up a beacon...

Well, you can't.
I want you out of here.

You're a petty person,
and you're insecure,

and you're taking it out on me.
That's a good script.

What the hell?!

I don't care. I want you out.

- What?
- Take that thing down.

Your grandson
is a shitty person. Leave now.

- Morty!
- Rick, I didn't do anything.

I sat through
his entire screenplay...

You "sat through it"?

Yes! Did you want me
to weep with joy?

- It's terrible!
- Whoa Morty! We're guests here.

I tried to be a good guest!
He dragged it out of me!

- I'm taking down this beacon.
- No, stop! That's not fair!

Just because
you hate your own writing

doesn't make me a bad person!

Aah!

You like that? You want me
to cut to three weeks earlier

when you were alive?

RICK: Whoa, Morty.
You just purged.

Beacon arriving.
[ DEVICE BEEPS ]

Okay, time to go.

- Well, terrific.
- [ SIGHS ]

Dad, what's going on?
What's the deal here?

I just wanted to spend some time
with my daughter.

You're growing up so fast.

- You used to be my little girl.
- [ CHUCKLES ] Yeah.

Remember when we used to
go to the playground,

and I'd push you on the swings?

Oh, you could push me higher
than all the other kids.

You were so small and cute.

I thought you were gonna fly
right off into the street.

[ CHUCKLING ]
I used to pee my pants.

I know, and now look at you!

You have a job.
You're making really good money.

You're not paying any rent,

so you have plenty
of disposable income.

Oh, god, Dad. Please, don't.

I just need
a few hundred dollars

to get through the month. I have
some interviews coming up.

Something's gonna come through.
I can feel it.

I'm going inside.

[ DOOR SHUTS ]

[ SIGHS ] I guess this is what
rock bottom feels like, Jerry.

Ow!

It's okay, Morty.

[ MEESEEKS CHEER ]

He's got it!

Th-Th-that's a lower
handicap stro-o-ke!

[ MEESEEKS CHEER ]

Excuse me.

I'm a bit of a
stickler Meeseeks.

What about your short game?

Oh, my god, oh, my god!

[ CRYING ]
What about your short game?!

[ PLINK ]

Ooh, nice!

[ BOTH MOAN ]

I think we'll take
our food to go.

No, you won't.

The police are coming.

You have so many
questions to answer.

Fair enough.

[ VILLAGERS CHEER ]

[ CHICKEN SQUAWKS ]

Thank you, kind sir.

Our village is saved!

You are both true heroes!

Oh!
[ LAUGHS ]

Good job, Morty.

Looks like you won the bet.

Thanks, Rick,
but I don't know if I should.

You know, you were
right about the Universe.

It's a crazy and chaotic place.

Well, you know, maybe that's
why it could use a little

cleaning up [BURPS] every
now and then, you know.

This one's wrapped up neat
and clean because we did it

Morty style.

Oh! Heroes, we would like to
introduce you to our beloved

King so that he may
thank you personally.

Uh, no, i-it's cool.

Rick. Portal. Hurry.

Aah!

[ VILLAGERS SCREAM ]

So...

you still thinking
about taking that trip?

[ SIGHS ] Jerry, look.

We don't have a
perfect marriage,

but I'm not going anywhere.

When we were in that freezer,

I realized the Meeseeks are like
the guys I went to High School with...

willing to say anything
