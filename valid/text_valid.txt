I can take out the "eternity"
and the padding,

and then you'll have some
time-traveling mittens.

Oh, look, it's Rosemary's Baby.

How's business?

Here's the last
of our inventory.

We're going to file chapter 1 and do some restructuring.

Sounds like code for
"You win, Rick."

That was important
to you, wasn't it?

Nope. Lt was important
to your dumb devil friend.

To me, this was all just a bit,

like when Bugs Bunny fucks
with the opera singer

for 20 minutes.

He tried to kill himself.

[ LAUGHING ]
Seriously? Holy crap.

Holy crap.

But you know what, Grandpa Rick?

He's strong, and he's never
going to give up.

- Uh-huh, yeah, I don't care.
- Oh, I know.

- Everyone knows you don't care.
- So?

So have fun not caring.

- I always do.
- Good.

Yeah, it is good.
[BURPS] It's the best.

I'm sure it is.

- Bye.
- Later.

I'm here to pick up
my undead cat and child.

Yeah, uh...
give me a sec.

These are the forms
for the employee health plan.

All right, yeah, put...
put them on my... eh.

I just got bored.

Everybody out.

JERRY:
All right, just one more rally,

then I promise we'll get back
to your science project.

Dad, Pluto isn't a planet.

It's shrinking because
of corporations.

Yeah, that's what that
anti-planet nut job

Scroopy Noopers was
screaming about

outside the Ministry of Money's
Fundraiser.

Are you telling me four billion
Plutonians are wrong?

You said science wasn't easy.

I said science
isn't a/ways easy.

Obviously, that means
sometimes it is easy.

Let's not debase ourselves
with word games, son.

Dad, their whole
planet is dying.

Ha! You called it a planet.
Checkmate.

What's up, Pluto?

[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]

[ CLASSICAL MUSIC PLAYS ]

Mr. Smith, please tell
my friend here

what you just told me.
Go on.

My very eager mother
just served us nine pickles,

and the "pickles" is Pluto.

[ SPUTTERS ]
My god, the man's a genius.

Um, excuse me.

Morty, what?

Dad, what did you
think about the recent report

published by
The Pluto Science Reader

linking Pluto-quakes, sinkholes,
and surface shrinkage

to deep-core plutonium
drilling?

Well, son, what did you think

when you were five
and you pooped your pants,

and you threw your poopy undies
out your bedroom window

because you thought it was like

throwing something
in the garbage?

[ LAUGHTER ]

I mean, I'm trimming the hedges,

and these things are just
hanging there.

Was I supposed to think
the poop bunny left them?

Good one, Dad.

Hey, Morty, you want to
go on a... oh.

Hey, Beth.
Hello?

Hey, Jerry, you in here
being stupid?

[ SIGHS, BURPS ]

[ ROBOT WHIRS ]

Thanks.

Hey, you know, I was thinking,
you know,

I might watch a movie.

I am not programmed for

[ BURPS ]

[ HUMS ]

Hey.
[CLEARS THROAT] Hey.

W-W-What's going on?

Um, can you help me do
the stupid science fair project?

Whatever.

PLUTONIAN:
Jerry, you must be so excited.

The Pluto-bel prize is
the highest honor

a scientist can receive.

I'm flattered and humbled.

Oh, I like that.
Use that in your speech.

Also, talk about Pluto
being a planet.

People like that.

Your highness, we've captured
Scroopy Noopers.

You animals! Animals!

Ooh, look who's little
journey's come to an end.

Take him to Pluto-namo Bay.

You can't kill the truth,
father.

- What?
- I can see you're confused.

Pluto-namo Bay is
a military prison...

a sort of play on words.

Did he call you "father"?

Scroopy Noopers,
the anti-planet nutjob,

is your son?

The young eat the old
if you let them, Jerry.

Pluto is a cold, cold
celestial dwarf.

- It's a what?
- Huh? Oh, planet.

[ LAUGHS ]

"Pluto is a cold,
cold planet."

That's what I meant.

Knock them dead out there, you.

[ ECHOING ] Pluto is...

[ SIGHS ] not a planet.

- [ SHOUTING ]
- Ow! It's not a planet.

Hey!
It's not a planet!

I'm an idiot, and I love my son.

It was a long six hours,

but we've overhauled
"Needful Things"

into the globally-compliant
web 4.
"E-nomenon," n33dful.Com,

spelled with threes
instead of "E's."

[ CHEERING ]

Okay, that's it.
We just got bought by Google!

Mm.
I'm so proud of you, Lucius.

So, how much did we make?

[ CHUCKLING ]
"We."

This is my business.
Security!

[ GASPS ]
You're Zuckerberg-ING me?

I was Zuckerberg-ING people

before Zuckerberg's balls
dropped.

I'm the devil, bitch!
What, what?!

[ FIDDLE PLAYS ]

Hey!
[ GROANS ]

- Hey, Morty.
- Oh, oh, hey, Dad.

Um, what... what are you doing
back from Pluto so quick?

Uh... some people just
can't handle the truth.

Especially dummies like me.

Morty, I'm not as smart
as your grandpa Rick,

but I promise never to make
that your problem again.

Hey, Dad.

Nobody's smarter than Rick,
but nobody else is my Dad.

You're a genius at that.

Wow.
[ SNIFFLES ]

That's... humbling
and flattering, son.

Thank you.

What say we finish ourselves
an eight-planet solar system?

Um... I'm just gonna
take this thing in

and get an "A."
- Butter.

- But...
- You're a genius...

at being my Dad, Dad.

Quit while you're ahead.

And also, knock next time,
you know?

I mean, I'm sitting in here,
I'm 14...

I got a computer in here,
you know?

Oh, I... I think
I understand.

You're really playing with fire

when you burst in here
like that, man.

I get it. Say no more.

I mean, one of these days,

you know, you're gonna end
up seeing something.

I got it!
Noted. Good night.

[ METAL MUSIC PLAYING ]

How's your pretend
grandpa doing, aka "The Devil"?

- He dumped me.
- Oof. Sorry.

Did we learn a lesson here
I'm not seeing?

Not sure.

Maybe in a much bigger way,

Mr. Needful gave us
both what we really wanted?

Because I was always jealous of
you hanging out with Morty,

and you didn't realize how much
you valued my approval?

- No, that's dumb.
- Yeah, not satisfying.

I'll tell you what, though.

If... if... if it's satisfaction
you're after,

I think I might have an idea.

Did you get any of that?

It's a good-a show!

﻿

- No, we're not.
- Okay, but we've been here for hours.

I-I don't want to hang out
at the stupid horse hospital.

This stupid horse hospital
puts dinner on your table.

It wouldn't kill you
to take an interest.

W-What's this thing? I-In
the middle of the room?

With -- With the
hole in the end?

That's a breeding mount.
The nurses use it to collect...

reproductive material.

Okay, let's go see this
latest piece of Marvel shit

you kids are jizzing over.

Yeah. A-About time.

So, d-does your
hospital ever need, like,

after-school volunteers?

Wow. Who are you and
where did you put my son?

Ha! No, no. Seriously.

I-I'm very interested
in -- in your work.

Morty, you dirty little doggy.

Ugh! Come on!

Hey, Rick.

Oh, hey, kiddo.
How's your Saturday?

You know, super chill.
W-W-Whatcha doin'?

Eh, nothing adventurous.

You know that race of
Underground Dwelling Cannibal

Horse People that
we're always fighting?

Yeah, the CHUDs.
W-W-What about 'em?

Well, don't tell anybody,
but I'm working on

a bioweapon to use against them,

so I got this barrel of horse
semen from your mom's hospital

and I'm just gonna, you know,

subject it to some
otherworldly forces.

Guess I should test
it, make sure it's --

- Make sure it's what?!
- Horse semen, obviously.

Okay, but it says it
is right on the barrel!

You're not being
very scientific, Morty.

Measure twice, cut once.
Especially with semen.

Did you even ask Mom
if you could have this?!

Morty, if I wanted to
steal horse semen, I'd --

Yes, I asked her. What
is at stake for you here?

- Why don't you trust labels?!
- All right! Fine! I won't test it!

God damn. Your generation
really picks random hills to die on.

Don't get too close.

I'm running an inhuman amount
of power through this semen.

Should be safe, though,
since the semen itself is,

you know, also
inhuman. Here we go.

W-What happened?!

The sperm, Morty!

They're super monster
sperm now! I blame myself.

Unless there was something
about the sperm I didn't know.

Are you -- Are you saying
that to mess with me?

What? Mess with you how?

Like, trying to get
me to say something?

Morty, I have no idea
what you're talking about!

For real? Yes!

Okay. Good. Then
-- Then it's your fault!

Dad, what the hell is going on?!

Beth, sweetheart, Can
you give me a minute?

I'm trying to steer around
the bodies of our neighbors.

Oh, that felt like Gene.

- That's on you, Beth.
- Dad, I swear--

Mom, it's -- it's not
Rick's fault, it's --

Space Sperm. What?!

Yeah. Space Sperm.

I-I've seen em' before,
but n-n-never like this.

Sperm from Space?

Very impressive verbal
forensic work, Jerry.

Holy shit. How big
are space dicks?

Don't answer that!
Damn, they must be huge.

Oh!

Oh, shit, oh, shit, shit.

Mr. Sanchez!

The President is very
eager to speak with you!

Morty, look, you gotta
do me a solid here.

Y-you want me to keep the secret
of where these things came from?

Yes, technically, it's
a lie, but I messed up,

and I'm embarrassed
'cause it's, you know, science.

No problem. I got
your back, dawg.

Really? Okay. Cool.
And thanks, Morty.

I thought that'd
be a harder sell.

Y-You did a shameful thing.

Dwelling on it isn't gonna
help, you know, am I right?

Sometimes you
just gotta wipe it off,

toss it in the trash, and
head back to study hall.

Uh, not getting the metaphor
but I'll take your hall pass.

Sanchez! Get the hell in here!

Space Sperm?

Jesus, how big -are space dicks?
- Same page club.

Well, Mr. President, the
theory of Cosmic DNA

has been around for
decades -- Chupacabras, Yeti,

Stonehenge, Ancient Rome.

Are these all myths,
monsters, legends,

or different names for
sperm from outer space?

I'll tell you what
I think, Sanchez.

I think either you
caused this mess,

or it's those godforsaken Horse
People that dwell underground.

--CHUDs. -CHUDs.
-That's them.

Ugh, if they're behind
this, so help me, God.

Morty, you've always
been a straight shooter.

You can't prove
that! Wait, what?

- Oh -- oh. Right.
- I can protect you, little man.

Blow that whistle. Toot, toot.

Is this your grandpa's fault?

Here's what I know, sir.

This is the greatest
country on Earth.

Aaaaaaaaaaaaah!!

Uh, Dad, how long are the days
on this planet?

Uh, computer, how long
are the days on this planet?

[ SCREAMING CONTINUES ]

42 hours.

All right, well,
those are the two choices,

'cause cob planet is
off the table.

Now let's take a vote.

MAN: Well, it's official.

The obscure planet
known as Earth,

formerly the hiding place
of interstellar terrorist

and fugitive Rick Sanchez,

has just become
the 6,048th planet

to join the Galactic Federation.

The plucky little ball
of water and dirt,

which is where it gets its name,

is dominated by seven billion
primate-descended natives

who love to eat spaghetti
and pray to kangaroos.

Spaghetti, kangaroos?
I've gotta check this place out.

[BOTH LAUGH] Well, you can.

Contact the Ministry of Tourism
for details.

Up next,
teenagers are calling it

[GROWLS AND SQUEALS]

And it's not what you think.

What are you...
What did you do that for?

Dramatic effect.

Good morning, family.
Oh, do I smell bacon?

Yes, we discovered
a species of tiny pig

off the coast of New Australia

about 30 yards east.
Or 300 yards west.

We'd offer you some,

but we hunted it to extinction
for breakfast.

Well, I thought
I'd walk to the South Pole

and do a little bit
of exploring.

If you guys need me, just yell

or throw something so hard

that it goes around the world
and hits me.

[ DOOR SHUTS ]
Okay, now that he's gone,

can we please talk about
our situation?

Dad, you can't talk about people
behind their back.

You know, it's a small world.

Please, he's in the South Pole!

And we need to have
a serious conversation.

[ INSECTS CHIRPING ]

[ THUNDER RUMBLES ]

[ WIND HOWLING ]

South Pole discovered, baby!

Ohhhh!

Oh fuck! An ice cave?

Shit!

Things just keep on
getting better.

Wow, it's the planet's core.

JERRY: I'm just saying,

we keep acting
like there's only two options,

but there's not.

So, yes, if we went
back to Earth,

as long as Rick was out there,
they'd wanna interrogate us.

But, and this is
purely hypothetical,

what if we turned your father in
to the government?

Jerry, so help me god,

if you ever bring this up again,
no more bacon.

There already is no more bacon!

This world sucks!
Our life sucks!

Why are we doing this
for someone

that would never do anything
for anyone but himself?

MORTY:
That's not the point, Dad!

We love Rick...
f-for the most part.

SUMMER: Yeah, you don't love
people in hopes of a reward,

Dad, you love them
unconditionally.

That's very good, kids.
I'm proud of you.

Okay, so let me
get this straight.

For the rest of your lives,

no matter how much it hurts you,

no matter how much it
destroys our children's futures,

we're gonna do whatever
Rick wants, whenever he wants?

- ALL: Yes.
- Why?!

Because I don't want him to
leave again, you dumb asshole!!

Hey. Uh...

I was gonna hope over
to the Gloppydrop system,

get some ice cream.

You... You want me to come with?

Don't you need my brain waves
for camouflage or something?

I'll be okay. Bye, Morty.

Rick?

You're not leaving, right?

Yeah, I am. To get ice cream.

So, you're coming back?

Morty, if you go to where
there's a bunch of ice cream

and then you don't come back,

you haven't
actually gotten ice cream,

you've just gone
where ice cream is.

Rick, I can handle it if you go,

but you'll break Mom's heart.

And I won't forgive you
for that.

Where's the van, Morty?

It's over the horizon
in the driveway.

where -- where --

where Jerry could really shine.

Rick, I'm not an idiot.

Oh. Okay, well, I told Morty,

"Look, parents get divorced.
They get sad. He'll be fine,"

but I think he's worried
you're gonna, you know...Pbht!

And you know how Morty gets
when he gets emotional.

did you think it was?

could we go

my kingdom, too, man.

He basically got me kicked out
of my home, stole my family.

Then we are brothers,
and you have wondered

what your life could have been
without Rick.

Wondered? Sure.

I mean, I've wondered
about having a vagina.

Would you help me kill him?

What? No!

He's my wife's father.
Move on.

Do you...like theme-park rides?

Oh, you really moved on.

There is a popular attraction
here called the Whirly Dirly.

Between the first whirly
and the third dirly,

the ride dips just outside
the immortality field.

You're asking me to lure Rick
to his death?

I'm only asking you
to go on a ride with Rick,

get off the ride without Rick,
and go home to your family,

where you can...
wonder about having a vagina.

Okay, okay, that was
a very specific example

pulled from thin air.

I don't want to be known
as the vagina guy.

Risotto, you're needed.
Someone ordered

the Nuzzy Guzzy Fresh
and Fluzzy Special.

[SIGHS DEJECTEDLY]
Look, I'm not like Rick,

so you're free to do
as you please.

But there comes a time
in every man's life

when he must choose
the foundation

on which his legacy
will be built --

one of compromise
or one of blood.

that's the title of the art.

Why was Knight Rider
called Knight Rider?

The car's name was Kitt.
Nobody rode Michael Knight.

You're overthinking it, Summer.
I'm Tiny Rick!

Grandpa, I think that,
when you put your mind

into this body's young brain,

it did what young brains do...

It shoved the bad
thoughts into the back

and put a wall around them.

But those bad thoughts
are the real Rick.

The fact that you're old,

the fact that we're all
going to die one day,

the fact that the universe
is so big,

nothing in it matters...
Those facts are who you are.

So you're trapped in there
and you can only come out

in the form of
Tiny Rick's teen angst!

Well, Summer, I hear

Toby Matthews
isn't into psycho chicks.

Can't think of anyone that is.

I'll see you motherfuckers

to re-create Jack's drowning

at the end of the movie.

It's so romantic.

I can't wait to do
that with Beth.

I don't know, Jerry.
With all due respect...

it seems like your wife
may not be that interested.

[ GASPS ] Look!

Iceberg, right ahead!
The buffet is now closed.

Uh, sir?
There's not a problem.

What do you mean
there's not a problem?

The guidance system
isn't putting us

on a direct collision course.

This ship is about to completely
miss the giant iceberg!

Well, do something!
Steer into it!

I'm trying!

It's too late.
Ladies and gentlemen...

don't brace yourselves.

- [ ALL GASPING ]
- JERRY: No! What happened?!

WOMAN:
Their rail system must have failed.

[ INDISTINCT MURMURING ]

Totally gonna get laid tonight.

I like your feathers.

They are designed to attract
the attention of the female.

It's working.

Tammy, I should let you know

I just got out of a highly
intense soul bond

with my previous spirit mate.

I'm not looking to get
into a soul bond.

I'm just looking for...

I believe Birdperson can
arrange that.

Hey, Summer, haven't seen you
at flute practice in a while.

Summer, don't tell me
you're friends with her.

Are you kidding me?

I don't even know
what she's doing here.

Whoa. Not cool, Summer.
This is a party.

Everybody should be welcome.

[ CRASHES ]

Oh, great. Who invited
Abradolph Lincoler?

I thought everyone was welcome.

It's not the same, Summer.

Lincoler is a crazed maniac...

just a misguided effort
of mine to create

a morally neutral
superleader by combining

the DNA of Adolf Hitler
and Abraham Lincoln.

Turns out it [BURPS] just adds
up to a lame, weird loser.

Rick, you brought me
into this world,

a suffering abomination

tortured by the duality
of its being.

But I shall finally know peace

when I watch the life drain
from your wretched body!

Whoa. What's up, man?

I have no quarrel with you, boy.

"Boy"?
What's that supposed to mean?

It's just... l-look,

I-I don't know how you thought
I meant it, but...

Don't look at me, dude.

Look, I'm
half-Abraham Lincoln, so...

So I should get on my knees
and kiss your ass?!

Well, no, but...

You know?
- What do I know?

That the Third Reich will reign
for a thousand years?

- Leave him alone, Brad.
- Stay out of this, Jessica!

Kick his ass, Brad!
Kick his ass!

ALL:
Kick his ass! Kick his ass!

Brad!

Stupid!
[ GRUNTS ]

Rick!

I just did you a favor, Morty.

Sorry about all that.

Rick has some really
strange friends.

Ugh! Brad is such a jerk.

He's always trying to prove
what a man he is.

I just want to find somebody
nice and sweet.

Jessica, can I show
you something?

- Wow! Look at all this stuff.
- Yeah.

This is me and my grandpa Rick's
sci-fi workshop.

Check this out.

[ PROJECTOR BEEPING ]

It's beautiful.

You know, Jessica,
there's something

I've always wanted to tell you.

- What's that, Morty?
- I think you're the most...

No, that...
those weird sounds

coming from the closet
over there.

[ CLOSET RATTLING ]

- Oh, my god!
- Aah!

Hey, I'm squanching in here!

Oh, my god!
Oh, that is so disgusting!

Ow! Oh! Oh, crap!

[ DEVICE WARBLING ]

[ WARBLING ]

[ ALL SCREAMING ]

Huh.
Big star in the sky.

[ INHALES SHARPLY ]
Oxygen-rich atmosphere.

Giant testicle monsters.

We'll be fine! Let's party!

[ ALL CHEERING ]

♪ Just shake that ass, bitch,
and let me see whatcha got ♪

♪ Just shake that ass... ♪

SUMMER: I swear to god, Morty,
if it weren't for the fact

that everyone's still
having a blast in there,

I would be so furious
with you right now.

Oh, man.
Y-You hear that, Morty?

You really lucked out
with Summer o-on that one.

How are you guys not
freaking out right now?!

T-The whole house is sitting
in another dimension!

I-I mean, w-what the hell
are we supposed to do?!

M-M-Mom and Dad are gonna
kill us!

I'm losing it here, Rick!
- Relax, Morty, relax!

It's gonna be fine.

All we have to do is go out
and find us

some Kalaxian crystals.

[ DETECTOR BEEPING ]
Oh, shit, motherfucker!

Kalaxian crystals, Morty,

just a few miles south of here.

Okay. Let's go, then.

W-W-We got to go get those
crystals right now, Rick.

Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Morty, l-I can't go with you.

I got to hang back

and make sure everything stays
cool here, you know?

I mean, who knows what... what
if somebody breaks something?

Yeah. Me too.
I should stay.

You guys have any aspirin?

Oh, hey, Morty, this is perfect!

You can take Lincoler with you.

Hey, I'm not going anywhere.
I'm injured.

Shut up, Lincoler.

It's the least you can do
for wrecking the living room.

Yeah! And, Nancy,
you should go, too.

What? Why... why me?

Because, uh, you're...

you're so good
at playing the flute.

CAPTAIN:
Sorry for the inconvenience, folks.

We should resume sinking shortly.

In the meantime, please,
stay on the ship

and enjoy a complimentary plate
of James Cameronion rings.

Great. Not only is
the ship not sinking,

but now the fourth wall
has been broken.

[ SIGHS ] I am gonna go back
to the room to finish my book.

You should find that Lucy woman.

But... but...

[ CLEARS THROAT ]
You see, Jerry?

May I show you something?

Had everything gone as planned,

this entire area
would be underwater.

[ SIGHS ]
I would have liked to see it.

This trip has been a "Titanic"
failure.

Get it?
Ooh!

- Draw me, Jerry.
- Oh, boy.

Lucy, wow.

Uh, this isn't
what I had in mind.

But it's the perfect moment.

We've been dreaming
about this for 16 years.

Um, not like this.
Not... not with you.

[ CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY ]

[ GUN COCKS ]
You are gonna draw me.

Then you're going to fuck
me in that car over there.

It's weird,
'cause I definitely think

that all men are created equal.

But, at the same time...
- Okay!

Um, the crystals should be
really close.

There they are!

Wait.
Something's not right.

[ CREATURE GROWLS ]

[ SCREAMS ]

[ CREATURE ROARS ]

Get the crystals!
I'll handle the beast!

Prepare to be emancipated from
your own inferior genes!

[ GRUNTING ]

[ GASPS ]
Summer's gonna like me again.

[ CREATURE GROWLING ]

[ GRUNTS ]

Lincoler, come on!
Let's get out of here!

Mein journey is over, Morty.

[ GROANING ] I have something
important to tell you.

♪ And the gears, they turned
for a thousand years ♪

♪ Until the dark day
that they stopped ♪

[ GASPS ] Rick, I got them!

I got the crystals!

All right!
You did it, Morty.

Rick, wait! There's something
you need to know.

I couldn't have done it
without Lincoler.

He said that he was really sorry

and that he loves you
When you're born
that big an asshole,

the least you can do is
have a little empathy.

Now, come have dinner
with my beautiful family.

And drop the Hitler stuff.

Wasp Morty's been on
some crazy message boards.

Aah! Aah!

Oh! Aah! Ow!

Me and my friends
want to fly around

and look for something
to sting tonight.

You be careful not to waste
all your venom.

I'm not a bee, Dad.

Oh, God! Kill me!
Please kill me!

Uh, Beth, uh, after dinner,
could I maybe borrow Morty

to help the lost Rick get back
to his primate-based reality?

Morty, are you done
with your homework?

Not all of it.
Sorry, Dad.

Oh, don't be sorry, sweetie.
We're all in this together.

We're wasps, not monsters.

Aah!

Huh, guess I don't have it
as bad as I thought.

Can you pass the acid?

Aah! No!
Run! Run, my babies!

Bonus!

Morty?
Morty?

Where is that little shit?
Morty!

Whoa, garage foul.

Who said you could
go through my stuff?

W-Where's my Boglin?

There you are.
Don't worry, Pop-pop's back.

I'll keep you safe.
What the --

He took my Meeseeks boxes!
All that's left are these

shitty Kirkland brand
Meeseeks boxes.

What do you want?

Damn,
your Morty sucks.

Aah, wasps!

Why the hell
didn't you show Morty

how to bring my body
back to life?

Don't tell me
you gained sentience

and tried to take over.
What?

That is some A.I.,
racist, accusatory,

Isaac Asimov bullshit
right there.

Then what happened?
Where's my body?

Oh, you're gonna
love this.

- I love you, Morty.
- This is my life.

This is good.

What do ya know?

Our little Morty knows
how to scream.

Oh, you're fucked now!
I told you!

Get him, Rick!

Aaaah!

Aah!
I-I can't see my own death.

H-How am I gonna die?!

Shh, quiet, idiot.
Quiet.

It's gonna be alright.

You don't get to know
how you're gonna die.

It's over.
Oh, hey.

This fucking ferrofluid's
wrapping around my legs.

Fuck!
I can feel! I have mass!

I'm a fucking god now!
You're fucked!

What the fuck?

I-I thought you were proud
to be a hologram!

That's 'cause I had
to fucking be one!

Shit! Aaah!

Ugh! Aaah!

There's a lesson here,

and I'm not the one
that's gonna figure it out.

Hey, uh, sorry
I didn't listen to you

and tried to kill
the whole world and stuff.

I guess I got to learn

how to live in the moment
a little more.

Oh, boy, so, you actually
learned something today?

What is this,
"Full House"?

I was living in the moment
all day,

and it kept getting me
killed by Nazis.

I think you have to think ahead
andlive in the moment.

Morty, we saw you on the news.
Are you okay?

Oh, real nice, Rick.
Turning our son into an Akira?

- Real nice.
- Eat my ass, Jerry.

He turned himself
into Akira.

Oh, I'll eat it,
because this is my house, Rick.

- I'll eat any ass I want.
- Gross.

You said the crystals wouldn't
hurt anyone, Dad.

This family has
a clean start.

I don't know if adventures
fit into my son's life.

I'm fine.
Get off Rick's back.

Rick wasn't even here
when I was doing all that stuff.

That was all on me.

Well, alright, Morty.

I guess, as long as you're okay,
that's all we care about.

I don't want to see
any more anime stuff

happening to my son,
buster.

That finger has AIDs now.
Not my fault.

You skipped HIV?

- He's messing with you, sweetie.
- But it's tingling!

So, I guess what we learned
is to split the diff.

From now on, Rick and Morty doing
a little of this and a little of that.

Yeah, sometimes
we'll do classic stuff.

You know, other times,
we'll do whatever!

Sometimes we won't even
do anything!

Rick and Morty do --
not doing anything!

A hundred years!Pushing it to the limit.

Rick and Morty,
not sticking to one path.

Trying different things,

Making sure to keep out
of a rut.

Doing stuff.
Sometimes not doing stuff.

Not even pushing a little bit
towards the limit.

Doing it alone or together.
Making sure to keep our eyes

on the prize.
Sometimes just relaxing.

Or not. And you can do whatever
the fuck you want, Morty.

- That's the end.
- Wait, wait, what the fuck?

H-Hold on. What the fuck
did you just say?

Nothing.
I didn't say anything.

I was just playing along
with you guys.

You know I record everything,
right?

Garage, isolate Summer's voice
and play back.

Oh, and then you guys
can get married,

and, like,
suck each other off

in a testosterone-addled
fucking third-grade-boy.

What, the hell, Summer?!
That's disgusting.

Gross, Summer!
Jesus Christ!

I was just joking around,
you --

just seeing if you guys
pay any attention to me.

Just want to be
a part of the fun.

Get the fuck
out of here!

Get out of here, Summer!

- Fucking disgusting!
- Get out of here!

You ruined
the Season 4 premiere!

The Season 4 premiere,
you ruined it!

God,
tomorrow's career day.

I don't want to think about what
I do when I get out of school.

I know exactly
what I want to do.

I want to work
in hospice.

I want to comfort
the people who are dying,

who have no one else
in their lives --

the real lonely people.

I'm gonna look at their name
tags, and I'm gonna say,

"I love you,"

followed by whatever it says
on their name tag,

over and over.

What the fuck?

Hey, Morty, quick favor.

What, cover me
in gasoline and spiders?

Fine, yeah, I'm in.

Wasn't my first pitch,

but, hey, not gonna waste
this opportunity.

Did you get any of that?

﻿I -- I can't hold them off,
Rick!

Th-There's too many!

Richard!

Your fortress is a salty
waste of coral and clam.

Relinquish it at once!

Aah!

Submit,
you continental cunt.

Aah!
Got a better idea.

Oh, shit! Oh, shit!
Oh, shit! Oh, shit!

Aah!

Aah!

Happy?
Of course I'm happy.

You're acting like you won,

but this is exactly
what I wanted!

I am Mr. Nimbus!

Ugh, whatever.
Come on, Morty.

Man, that was intense.

Yeah nice work,
buddy.

Sorry I had to
blow up your bunker.

Not so fast, Sanchez.

It is I, Cookie Magneto.

What the fuck?

I'm -- I'm not engaging
this guy.

That's hardly
up to you, Rick.

I'm sorry, do you control things
that people agree are cookies?

Yes.
Okay, but cookies
aren't a substance.

They're more of a name
we -- we give to --

To the things I control.

Do you control cookie
ingredients?

Because, y'know,
t-that sounds dangerous.

Y'know,
everything has sugar in it.

Fight me and find --

Aah!

Jesus, Rick!
I'm sorry, Morty.

I know you're gonna say
it's punching down,

but I can't fight another
one of these '90s-style

goofball super villains.

I'm not
the fucking Tick.

I'm -- I'm exhausted.
Okay, but i-if you really

have a lot of these guys
gunning for you,

maybe you should look into
what you're doing to --

Oh, don't start that crap,
Morty.

I don't do anything for these
dipshits to seek me out.

I am Mr. Calypso!

Face me, you ugly, drunk,
ugly piece of shit.

Okay, I might look into it.

Why don't you have a seat?
'Cause this isn't
a therapy session.

I-I'm just asking you
what people in your racket

say about handling
this particular situation.

First, we'd want you
to define the situation.

I'm a walking target for a
never-ending sea of angry nerds

that think getting in a fight
with me is some kind of...

I don't know, platform?

I mean,
look at this guy.

He shows up and calls me
an "ugly drunk."

Because of course
that's the angle of attack

that's gonna undo me,
right?

You don't shoot Batman
in his fucking Batman logo.

And you think
locking this man in a chamber

and milking him of cosmic fluid
will somehow resolve this?

I think it's the best I can do
to profit from a situation

and maybe set an example.

But you've set this example
many times

and it's not changing
your situation.

Yeah, yeah, yeah, and now you're
gonna tell me to ignore them.

But guess what?
They want that too.

And why would they want
to be ignored?

You really believe if I let
a guy like this

do whatever he wants,
he gets bored and vanishes?

Rick, would you be interested
in proving me wrong?

Yes!
Then show me data.

Ignore them for a week
and see what happens.

You're on, bitch.

Is that man dead?

Is everything in here
confidential?

Everything but murder.

Then he's fine.

I mean, I-I think
it's pretty big, you know?

Big step
for the big cheese.

Yeah, Dad, I'm impressed.

Can we not
make it a big deal?

It's worth celebrating,
Rick.

You accepted the concept
of therapy

without turning yourself
into a pickle or a housefly.

Jerry, for fuck's sake,
that was a regular fly

in her office that day.

What the hell?
Riiick!

How 'bout a little piss?

Rick, why is there a man
shooting piss on our front lawn?

I'm sure he'll tell you.

I am Pissmaster!

Here to flush the toilet
that is Rick Sanchez.

He's spraying
my lavender bush.

My bees
need that lavender!

Remember five seconds ago

when you guys were stoked
about me changing

because it made
you feel superior?

Ooh,
whole family's here.

Who's that redhead?

Wouldn't mind spraying her
with a golden shower.

-Oh, my God, what?
-Hey!

Okay, that's it!

Jerry, please
think about this.

If you fight this guy,
I'm either an asshole

for not helping
or an asshole for helping.

My daughter just got
spoken of in porno terms,

and I'll respond
how I choose!

-Wait, Dad, don't!
-Honey!

Hey.

You want a piece of piss?

If that's your stupid rude way
of saying

I have to fight you,
I will.

Take your shot, pussy.

Don't talk to me that way.
Go away!

Make me.
Go away!

Ow!

Careful, honey!

Just stay down.

I --
I don't even know you.

Yeah, you don't know me.

But I'm gonna know your whole
ass, you son of a gun.

Hey, none of that!
Break it up, guys!

Hey! Come on!

Come on, you dirty
motherfucker.

No! No, no, no, no no!

Stop! Aah!

Uncle! Mercy! Mercy!

Stop! I give up!

Apologize to my daughter.

For what?

You know for what!

I'm sorry!

I'm sorry I sexualized you!

It came out wrong!

That's my dad.
That's my fucking dad!

Honey, I'm so proud of you.

Ow!

Oh, sorry.

Thank you, Rick.

Damn, hashtag
#FlamingoDad is everywhere!

Buzzfeed made
an odd numbered list

of other people's
observations about you,

and you're getting
a lot of hand clap emojis

on White Twitter's
impression of Black Twitter.

Jezebel's offering
a cash reward for evidence

that you're a bad person.

That is
their highest honor!

So this is what
it's like to trend.

Feels good.
Feels right.

Just keep in mind,
now a bunch more assholes

are gonna know they can get
a rise out of you.

Boooo!
Rick, let a dog
have one day.

I'm letting!
I'm letting!

Whoa.
Are those orbs?

This is
what I'm talking about.

Some asshole saw that fight
and, believe it not,

they were jealous
of Pissmaster.

I am
Blagnar the Eternal.

We seek the earthling
who beat up Pissmaster.

That's my dad,
Jerry Smith!

Jerry Smith.

Our Galactic Orbship
thirsts for justice

and those who deliver it.
Wait, what?

Our great council would like
to offer you this silver orb

and with it
a place amongst us.

Whoa.
It -- It -- It's sticky.

Yeah, that means
it's found a pure heart

it wants to bond with.

Y-You guys saw
my son-in-law on the news,

now he gets a sticky orb.

What's the catch?
We're not rubes.

Yeah, your power is well
known in our jurisdiction,

Rick Sanchez, and it should
come as no surprise

that our orbs
are unsticky for you.

Oh, no, first I get banned
from the Nextdoor app,

now this.

I'd be honored to join
your organization.

S-So what do I do?
Rub the orb when I see crime?

Or -- Or eat the orb
like spinach?

The orb is raw power.

Trust your heart,
Jerry.

It will know what to do.

Did you turn on the microwave?

No? Maybe?

I -- I was trying to fly.
I --

What?
I mean, come on, Rick.

Orbs and goblets,
this is your thing.

Orbs and goblets.

I'm just saying, you're
the orb guy in the family.

Can you please help me?

Jerry, I give you raw power,
you'll end up miserable like me.

Trust me, I'm helping
by not helping.

-Wow.
-Seriously, Rick?

What the eff, Grandpa?

Some creep tried to pee
on my tits and you did nothing.

Now you're gonna sit there
and hold our dad back

from being a hero?

Are you seriously
that petty?

Okay, you know what?
Fine!

Here.
Here's your goddamn suit.

I hard-wired the orb's
infinite energy right into it.

This shooty-thing looks cool.

That "shooty thing"
is a nuclear disruptor

that can blow up planets.
Whoa.

So tight.
Kinda hot.

Okay, show me, uh...

acts of evil happening
around the galaxy.

Whoa, Space Hitlers?

"Space Hitlers are convening
on Zeplar Prime."

My God, each one of them
is their own type of Hitler.

Yeah,
th-that's a problem.
Oh, shit, do that one.

Aw, you guys.
That's my parents.

Wow.

Well, family,

looks like Jerry Smith

has his first orb mission.

Lawn Flaming-Ho!

Just a reminder,
you guys asked for this.

Soon,
our legion of Hitlers

will bring
about a new galactic order.

A reich, if you will.

Riddle Hitler me this --

I'm sorry, are we just
letting in all Hitlers now?

Auf wiedersehen, bad guys!

Exterminate him!
Shit! We need to find shelter
before the sunset, Morty.

Venzenulon Nine has a night
temperature of 300 below!

We'll freeze, Morty!
W-We'll be dead in seconds!

L-| think I saw
a cave over there.

You've seen
too many movies, Morty.

A cave isn't gonna cut it.
We're gonna have to use Beebo.

Beebo led us to water!
He's our friend!

- He won't even feel it!
- Oh, no, no!

[BEEBO GROANS]

You wanna die, Morty?
Get in Beebo!

Oh, no, no!

Brace for the ice limit.

Here it comes!

Wait, are we on Venzenulon Nine
or Venzenulon Seven?

Wait a minute. Why would I ask
for that to be removed?

Are the red ones stuff
you wanted removed?

Ooh, that's clever, Morty, but
I don't use color to sort things

because I'm not a mouse in
a European children's book.

Then why are all those
pink ones by the liquor?

Liquor?

[RAY GUNS BLASTING]

[ BOTH SIGH ]

- Shit, that was close.
- We lost Captain Sky.

He gave his life
for the uprising.

Yeah. It really makes
you think, huh, Morty?

We should never take
things for granite.

- What?
- I'm just saying, life's short.

We shouldn't take things
for granite.

- Are you saying "granite"?
- Well, yeah.

It's "granted," with a

Take things for granted.
Did you actually think it was --

[LAUGHS]
Jesus Christ, Rick,

what are you, a boulder --
a rock person?

How long have you been
saying that wrong?

Oh, you like that, huh?

I b-b-bet that really
blows your mind.

I mean, yeah,
it's kind of great.

- You want me to erase it?
- What, you can do that?

-[ BUZZING ]
- Ah, shit.

I fucking knew it,
you piece of shit!

You -- You --
You're a fucking asshole, Rick!

Take it easy, Morty.
Come on. Just relax.

No, I'm not gonna fucking relax!
Come here!

Let go of me, you little bitch!

I'm gonna grab you
by the scruff of your --

- Take that!
- Ohh!

- Umm.
- Umm. Uhh.

- What --
- What's going on?

- Where am I?
- Who are we?

- Who am I?
- I think I'm an adolescent boy.

Huh, and I'm an elderly man.

And we appear to be in some kind
of secret confined space.

- Yeah, umm...
- Don't look at me like that.

For all we know, you could be
the fuckin' weirdo.

Huh, these things are
obviously storage units,

and since we can't remember
what went wrong,

my guess is that the technology
involves memory

and that this thing on your head
is designed to...

Tell us the code, jagoff!

[SPEAKING ALIEN LANGUAGE]

It's pointless.
He's stonewalling.

Rick, if we don't unlock
those vaccines, Earth dies!

You know, it might be time
to step up your interrogation!

Not sure what
you're implying, Morty,

but some lines I don't cross.

Yeah, well,
I crossed every line I had

when this bastard
tried to kill Jessica!

[SPEAKING ALIEN LANGUAGE]

Okay, see those two fleshy sacs
under his chin, Morty?

Grab 'em.

You remember the codes now?

- Twist!
-[ SCREAMING]

Give us the codes, man!
Twist harder, Morty!

- Harder!
-[ SCREAMING]

Okay, let go, let go,
let him breathe.

[SPEAKING ALIEN LANGUAGE]

He wants to make a deal.

Half the codes now,
half after you finish.

But can we trust --
Wait, what?

F-Finish what?

Y-You know.

I thought I was torturing him!

Oh, and this disappoints you?

Do I tell him we don't
have a deal, Morty?

Because if we can
kill our enemies

but we can't jack them off, then
how are we better than them?

Well, what did you find out?

We're partners, I guess,

and we fight aliens,
like "Men in Black"?

"Men in Black," "Men in Black."

I have "Men in Black 2" in here.

So -- So you get
the general idea.

[LAUGHS]
Not quite.

It's basically an endless string
of callbacks to --

All right, save it for YouTube.
I'll keep looking for clues.

What are you doing?

You want your shelf
level or not?

And if I say yes, you're gonna
provide that for me with that?

Yes, see the bubble?

I'm familiar with
the bubble, Morty.

I also dabble in precision,

and if you think
you can even approach it

with your sad, naked,
caveman eyeball

and a bubble of fucking air,
you're the reason this species

is a failure,
and it makes me angry!

You're drunk.

You want to put up a shelf,
put up a shelf.

You want to experience
true level?

- Do you?
-[ SIGHS DRAMATICALLY] Y-yes.

[POWERING UP]

Ugh, all right, come on.

[SIGHS]

Wow, it's so --

Oh, oh, oh, oh, my God, oh,
Christ, ooh, ooh, ooh, ahh.

Oh, yeah, true level, bitch.

Morty, come on,
we're leaving for school.

Oh, everything's crooked!
Reality is poison!

I want to go back!
I hate this!

- What's his deal?
- Can't live like this!

Shh, shh, shh, shh, Morty,
Morty, Morty.

Go to school, Summer.
I'll go in Morty's memory

and do a little --
[CLICKS TONGUE]

Lambs to the cosmic sLAUGHTER!

Well?

You seem to be in charge
of what I get to remember.

- Why?
- Good question.

Morty, I need darkness to prime
these optical inductors.

Hit the leftmost light switch
by the door for me.

The left.

[ CLICK, CLICK, CLICK]

Okay, lights on.

[SIGHS]

So, did I just hear three
distinct light switch clicks?

W-W-What do you mean?

I feel like the three sounds
I heard could be explained

by an initial erroneous flipping
of a switch on the right

followed by a hasty,
corrective flipping

of the requested switch.

Then during the resultant
darkness and silence, a third,

shameful unflipping of
the initially flipped switch.

Is my assessment accurate?

Yeah, that's -- that's basically
how -- how it all shaked out.

- I'm sorry.
- Ugh. All right, come on.

- What?!
- Come on!

[HIGH-PITCHED TONE]

-[ CLICK, TONE ENDS]
- Grab a shovel.

W-What is --

Grab a shovel!

[CLICK]

What was that?

I can't find a goddamn
zip tie anywhere!

All right, fuck it!

[ BEEPING ]

[MAGNETIZING]

Ahh, zip tie.

[ POWERING DOWN]

[ BEEPING ]

[MAGNETIZING]

[WOMEN SCREAMING]

Why are you making me
do this for you again?

Who doesn't wish they could
talk to animals, Rick?

Most humans!

There, I'm done.
Just stay out of trouble!

Gotta keep moving.
Can't stop.

Up, down, down, up, up, up,
down, up, stop, down.

The queen needs food.
The babies need food.

The queen makes babies.

MALE VOICE:
The situation in Argentina

has proven less convenient
than predicted.

We'll have to re-destabilize
their economy,

refocus labor class outrage
from upper to middle,

foster a coup, and install
a compliant regime.

MALE SQUIRREL:
Same as Guatemala?

Yes, but you can double-time it.

We need a quorum
to pick a new pope

in case the Exxon/Monsanto thing
falls through in Africa.

Why not use chemtrails?
Put a canopy on Uganda.

They're set to agitate
any mo-- What?

That kid is watching us.

So, we're squirrels.
He's a kid.

He's watching us like he hears
what we're saying.

Hey, kid. Young man?
Come here, little boy.

Tell Daphne to run a on a possible Dolittle.

Little boy! We'll give you
wishes if you can hear us!

We can make you fly
and get candy.

[SQUIRRELS CHITTERING]

[WHISTLING]

Oh, fuck! Oh, fuck!
Fuck me! Fuck me!

[PANTING] Rick!

RICK: Ah, shit, Morty,
what did you do?

[POWERING UP]

-[ ZAP!]
-[ SQUIRRELS SCREECHING]

All right, Morty,
pack your shit!

That's only gonna keep 'em down
for a little bit, Morty!

You fucked with
squirrels, Morty!

We got a good five minutes

before they're backing up
on our ass, Morty!

We have to pack up and move
to a new reality, Morty!

You know I said we could
only do that a couple of times!

We're fucked over here because
of these damn squirrels, Morty!

I don't know what
my reaction is,

but I think I'm mounting
in suspicion of you.

- Well, what are you gonna do?
- I'm gonna remember everything!

Everything!

-[ SCREAMS]
-[LAUGHS]

[SCREAMS]

-[ FARTS]
-[LAUGHS]

Yeah!

Ow!

Ah!

Ow!

[CRYING]

Well, what'd you find out?

Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, what
are you gonna do, kill me?

No, I'm not gonna kill you.
I'm gonna kill myself!

All those memories just erased!

Sitting in this room
collecting dust!

W-What's the point of going on
if most of everything

that happens just ends up
sitting in here?

All right, kid.

I don't know much aside from
the fact that "Men in Black 2"

was a joyless cash grab, but I
do know that whatever you have

brewing around in your noggin
really connected with you.

I can't deny that,

and I can't deny that I'm
inspired by your passion.

I want in.
Suicide pact!

-[ RAY GUN POWERS UP]
- Yes, yeah, let's do it!

Together, you old
son of a bitch! On three!

One...

Two...

You guys doing
Morty's Mind Blowers?

Morty's Mind Blowers?

[SIGHS ] Grandpa,
is this a scenario three?

Uh, w-what's that,
and w-who are you?

Oh, man, it's a scenario four.

-[ SPITS]
-[ DART GUN SHOOTING]

Ugh, fucking God damn it!

I don't get paid enough
for this shit!

<i>There's a Craftsman nearby.
I can smell it.</i>

Whoa, what -- what --

<i>Can I help you?</i>

H-How did we fall asleep during
interdimensional cable?

- Yeah, what the hell, Summer?
- Summer, you dumb bitch!

How long were we out,
you dumb bitch!

How much interdimensional cable
did we miss, you stupid bitch!

How many improv TV shows with
commercials did we miss, Summer?

Why did you let us fall asleep?

- You dumb bitch!
- You stupid bitch!

All right, Morty,
fuck this noise.

Let's get out of here
and go on a classic

- Rick and Morty adventure.
- Yeah, right, Rick, I'm all-in.

No wonder you're
constantly fighting

with each other
and behind schedule.

- What?
- Nothing.

[ROCK MUSIC PLAYS]

Rick?
Hello?

Just here for my putter.

Jerry's Mind Blowers?

Follow the boys!

We're charged and aimed
at Alpha Centauri,

ready for transport.

They fell for it!
Let's send Gobo home!

-[ LAUGHTER]
- All right!

- Where's Dad?
- He should be here any second.

It's funny, Jerry spent his life
seeking attention,

but in the end, humanity's
instinctive dismissal of him

saved an alien's life.

He knows where to go, right?

Yep, any minute now.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

Did it work?
Did you guys get Gobo home?

You have Gobo! You were supposed
to bring him to the hill!

As if.
He was in your basket.

He was in your car!

[CHEWING]

Oh!

Oof!
Dibs on his stuff.

Oh, shit,
I almost parked.

Hey, Morty, hold on,
wat-watch this.

Uh-huh.

Well,
I thought it was cool.

So.
We should be in and out.

Simple exchange,
not even really an adventure.

And if anything goes wrong --
which it won't --

jump into the same vat of acid
I jump into.

Okay.
Wait -- Wait, what?

Wha-What vat of acid?What, Morty!

Close the door.

I pre-scouted
this location

and placed a vat of fake acid
amongst the real ones.

It's got air hoses

and a compartment of bones
at the bottom.

If things go wrong,
which they won't,

we jump into
the vat of acid,

and I'll release the bones,
they'll float up --

What is this face
you're making?

Aren't you an inventor?

Yeah, what part of a fake acid
vat with built-in air supply

and quick-release bones
isn't inventive enough for you,

and when did my job become
pitching you ideas?

Alright!
Let's just do this.

I have English homework.You're still
learning English?

That's the language
you speak.

How dumb are you?

Interesting choice
of meeting place, Rick.

You like it?
My grandson had notes.

- Come on.
- Show him the crystals, Morty.

I'll make lots of money
with these.

I'll make lots of those
with these.Well. Those are fake.

- Oh, Jesus fucking Christ. Come on.
- You gotta be kidding me. Seriously?

You brought fake crystals
anda gun?

Beats real crystals
and no gun.

Okay, but does anything beat
fake crystals and a fake arm?

Whoa,
do you know who I am?!

Even if you kill me,
you're a dead man.

Are you serious?

Morty, he's right.
We're screwed.

Let's just end it.
Quick death, come on.

Aw, man. Oh!

Eh!

Holy shit, what the fuck?

Holy shit.

What kind of psycho...?

His own grandson?

Guess he took
your threat pretty serious.

Yeah, but it just...

doesn't make any sense.

Well,
he was a scientist.

Maybe he knew more
about acid,

maybe it's like
the most painless way to go.

How could that
have been painless?

You saw that pause
before the bones floated up,

that had to be five seconds
of unparalleled torture.

I...
I can't get my head around it.

I-I thought I'd seen
this galaxy at its darkest.

This is -- This is gonna take
a while to feel normal.

We're pretty good listeners,
boss.

Drinks are on us
if you want to talk it out.

Thanks, but...

what happened,
it happened here.

I don't want
to lose the moment.

Take your time, boss.

We'll stay here
as long as you want.

Absolutely.
I got nowhere to be.

And then
little Tommy FlimFlam's

running down
the Hyperloop.

His ass is on fire
from Xenon fluid,

but his AI hologram
is fuckin' his own pee hole.

Great story, boss.
Really detailed.

Yeah, well,
I got a million of 'em.

Alright.

I think I'm ready
to deal with the world now.

Let's get out of here.

Should we drop our buddy
in here before we go?

Yeah,
probably a good idea.

Should we use
a different vat?

Does acid lose its acid power
the more it dissolves?

What am I,
an acidologist?

Here, grab that
ratlike creature,

we'll do a little test.

Look, if you're going to test
the damn acid, don't use a rat,

take that ladle,
grab a spoonful,

and put it in the analyzer.

- Oh! - Hey!
- Oh!

Okay, I'd say that's
pretty acidy. Drop him in.

What are you doing?

You said -- Not the rat!

The guy!

Ooh! Marone!

Look at the size
of the bones on that rat!

Oh!

How many sets of bones
this rat got?

And look how
the smaller ones are shaped!

They're like little
cartoon bones,

like if you drew a bone
in art class!

Alright,
that tears it.

I'm canceling
the rest of my night

and calling a bone scientist.

We're getting to the bottom
of this --

Jesus fucking Christ,
enough already!

- Oh! - Hey!
- Whoa!

Can we go?

The fuck
is wrong with you?

Just admit
it was a shitty idea!

Having a grandson?

A vat of fake acid!

Are you dying
of dementia?

How are you talking to me
like this?

Wh-When did you get
so cocky?

Tonight!
Tonight, Rick!

The night
I saw you fail!

Because you ruined it!It was pre-ruined!

Oh, was it worse than
when I was a pickle?

Oh-oh-oh that's right,
you weren't there for that.

Turned out
kind of cool.

Maybe there's
a connection there.Excuse me?

What's that cool thing
you did without me again?

The awesome thing?

I-I-I guess
you wanted a dragon?

Mwah. Unforgettable.

God, fuck you.

Timely, too,
you really got in on that

"Game of Thrones" fever
right at the peak.

You trying as hard
as you can to hurt me right now

proves my point.

I'll let you know
when you have a point

and the world will know
when I try to hurt you.

Big man, big genius.
Big lonely drunk.

Hey, save some of these
atomic-age beatnik zingers

for your
English homework, Bukowski.

There's no such thing
as a bad idea, Morty.

It's about execution.

No such thing
as a bad idea?

Except all of mine,
right?

Morty, wanting a dragon
isn't an idea.

I'm not talking
about that!

I'm constantly pitching you
ideas, Rick,

and you act like they're
not even worth thinking about!

What,
the helicopter lawn chair?

That's just something
you saw on TV.

What about my video-game-style
place-saving device?

Oh, my God,
here we go.

It's a good idea, Rick!
A device that lets you --

Save your place
like in a video game

but in real life
so that you can try stuff

and then go back
to your save point,

yes, Morty,
I saw it on "Futurama."

Oh, so you don't do anything
unless it's original?

I don't do
time travel.

It's not time travel,
it's saving a place in time --

Oh, my God,
is this what you think I do?

This is where the heavy lifting
happens in your mind?

Do you have any idea
how much fucking work

would have to go into
a machine that --

Ah-ha!
You can't do it!

I can do anything,
Morty.

Your idea
is not worth doing.

You can't do it.

Before what you're trying to do
was called "negging,"

it was called
"reverse psychology,"

and incels didn't invent it,
Bugs Bunny did.

You can't do it.There is nothing
I cannot do.

A place-saving
video-game thing!You're a piece of shit!

- Just say you can't do it!
- I won't!

You won't say
you can't?

Fuck you, Morty!Fuck you!

Fuck you!

Son of a bitch.

So are you gonna --Yes,
I'm gonna fucking do it!

Rick, it's 3:00 a.m.

Wh-Wh-What's going on?
W-Why'd you call me?

You were right, Morty.

I failed.
I can't make it.

And honestly,
I'm pretty ashamed.

That might be why I've been
so aggressive and unfair

about rejecting
your ideas.

- Rick...
- A fake acid vat, Morty?

Maybe I've lost it.
Maybe I never had it.

Hey. C'mon. Y-You know
I didn't mean it that way.

I just think we need to find
better ways to communicate.

I'm sorry. I just...
I lash out sometimes.

I-I-I don't know why I do that!
I'm so ashamed of myself.

Hearing you talk about
the vat...

it really
opened my eyes.

- Like what the fuck am I even doing?
- Hey, hey.

I don't like hearing this talk.
You're a great inventor.

We just got a couple things
to work on.

Let's start with inventing
a little honesty.

Sound good?Thank you, Morty.
Sounds good.

- Or maybe I'll just kill you.
- What?

Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, Rick --

Because I fucking did it!Oh-ho-ho!

Booya!
Holy shit!

You did it!
You did it!

I did it,
you little son of a bitch!

How did you --Morty,
do you want me to explain,

or you wanna
go have some fun?I wanna have some fun!

Oh, my God.

Rick, this is --
this is -- thank you!

You can thank me later.
Go nuts.

Best grandpa ever!

That's all I ever wanted
to hear.

Alright, class,

I know I've been absent
for most of this school year.

I'll be honest with you --
during spring break,

I attended
a renaissance faire

and fell in love with a buxom
hand-axe juggler half my age.

I overplayed my interest
in her lifestyle

just to get closer to her,

traveling the country
with her troupe,

and I am embarrassed to say
I am now an expert blacksmith

with several STDs
and a broken heart.

I beseech your nasty
little asses

to speak on the matter
no further.

Now that that's out of the way,
who wants to do some math?

I'll do it.A bold move,
Morty Smith.

But can you deliver?

Oh, I've got something
to deliver.

Ahh!
Oh, God.

What the hell!

Aw, goddamnit,
this is traumatizing.

Oh, my God, what's wrong
with your dick?

Not cool.
I'm allergic to sheepskin!

Bold move, Morty Smith.
But can you deliver?

Holy shit.
I can do anything.

Yes, with math,
anything is possible.

Except a long-term relationship
with a woman

that calls you a warlock
for using a phone.

Hi, uh, hey, Jessica.

Oh.
Hey, Morty.

Hey...
Jessica, right?

Um. Yeah.
Hi. Sorry.

I thought
you knew my name

because we've interacted
so many times,

but maybe I was
just being stupid.

Sorry. Hi.
I-I'm Jessica. That's me.

Cool.
See you around.

Jessica. Yeah.
I hope I see you.

Around.
Guess we'll see.

I think I'm gonna
like this thing.

Hey, I'm sorry I brushed you off
the other day.

I was just
trying to be cool --

Oh, I don't even know
what you're talking about.

But...
you seem different.

Like you finally
found yourself.

Yeah.
I -- I guess I have.

That's good to hear.
I like who you found.

Yeah.
Yeah, I do, too.

Looking forward
to seeing more.

I'll see you tomorrow,
Morty.

Yeah.
Yeah, I'll see you tomorrow.

How's it going?

Y'know, it was fun, Rick.
Real fun.

Y'know I-I-I definitely
sowed those oats.

But I think you invented

a little lesson for me
along the way.

Living without
consequences is great,

but then I started
wondering...

what am I living for?

What am I building?

If I'm always looking back,
I'm never looking ahead.

And then it hit me.

We are who we are
because of consequences.

You can't live
without consequences, y'know?

You feel me?

Wow.

That's a beautiful thought,
Morty, but, uh, no.

There were definitely
consequences.

What're-What-What are you
talking about?

I mean.
You did everything you did.

It all happened.

No.
But the -- the respawn button.

The -- The do-over.It's not a do-over.

You just did it.
Over and over.

What are you saying?
W-What did you do?

I think it's more appropriate
to ask what did youdo?

You see, Morty, you weren't
saving your place

and going back.

I don't respect
time travel.

If "Ant Man and the Wasp"
can do it, I'm not interested.

It wasn't
so much a do-over

as it was isolating
a moment in time,

splitting your
probable selves,

and shunting you into
to into a near-duplicate,

equally probable reality,
transporting you into it

at the moment
of parallel determination.

Pretty nifty. Time crystals
are a bitch and a half,

but the only real hitch is that
there was already a you

in each
probable dimension.

So we had to solve
for that.

That's right,
you little bitch!

It's "The Prestige"!
You "Prestige'd" yourself!

Rick,
how many did I kill?You tell me, Morty.

Every time you reset
to smell Jessica's hair,

every time you relived
a satisfying fart,

that's how many Mortys
you've incinerated,

you greedy
little junkie.

Oh, God --
even those times when I --

Especially those times.

It's over, Morty. Feel this.

Take this in.
This is God.

Wh-Wh-Wh-Wh --
Why would you do this?

My hands are clean, Morty.
I gave you a choice.

You could
listen to me explain,

in great scientific detail,
how it all works...

or you could have fun.

Did you have fun,
Morty?

Is this
because of the vat?

No.
I'm sorry.

I'm afraid it's too late
for that, Morty.

What's done is done,
but it can end.

The original split
is still timestamped.

I can make it so those Mortys
never existed at all,

make them
purely theoretical.

Oh, God.
What do I do?

I think it's clear
you've done enough.

Tell me how, Rick!
Tell me how I save those Mortys!

You live
with the consequences.

Those things
happened somewhere,

but you can merge
the probable realities

so that only one Morty
did them.

Just do it.

Alright, lemme just
sync these up

and get you back
to your dimension.

Wait, so -- so you're not even
my Rick?

Then -- Then why do you know
about the vat?

Every Rick has a vat!

Well, Morty, I'd say

we've invented
a little honesty today.

How about you?I don't deserve this.

I was just having fun.

So was Jeffrey Dahmer.

Speaking of,
time to pay the piper.

Morty Smith.

Come out with your hands up,
you sick fuck.

We're also fine
with just shooting you

if you wanna
suicide by cop.

What?
What is this?

Wow.
Looks like a SWAT Team,

some drug dealers,

some grassroots MeToo activists,
the ACLU --

Jesus, Morty,
the AARP?

I don't wanna
talk about it!The NAACP, GamerGate...

Morty, is that Supreme Court
Justice Sonia Sotomayor?

I'm sorry!
I -- I'm sorry!

I-Is that
what you want me to say?

What -- What do I do?Oof, well, I'm stumped.

Seems like there's no way
out of this one.

Unless...

God damn it.

Yeah, I guess it is, uh --
what did you call it?

Uh, uh,
"A shitty idea"?

God damn it.Say the vat is good.

The vat is good.

Kiss the vat.

Do not
go into that vat.

It appears to be
full of acid.

It is!
Please, he's just a little boy!

Let me talk to him.Tell him
we're very upset!

Morty, please.
Step back.

That vat
is full of acid.

It'll melt you completely,
leaving only your bones.

- Goddamn it!
- I'm sorry, what did you say?

I'm going in the vat!

Oh! God!
Aw, I blame myself!

Oh, what a tragedy.

This --
Oh, well, he's bones now.

I guess all debts are paid.

Agreed.
He's definitely dead.

Why else
would the bones come up?

While his actions
were horrifying

and we are well within
our rights to be outraged,

I do wonder if we bear
some responsibility

for this young man
melting himself in acid.

Are we here for justice...
or something else?

"Though justice be thy plea,
consider this,

that in the course
of justice...

none of us
should see salvation.

We do pray for mercy."

"Merchant of Venice,"
nice.

Very cool.
Lots to think about.

Vengeance is a tomb,
all-encompassing --

Alright, okay, this isn't a
poetry reading, a kid just died.

Every -- Everybody go home and
hug your loved one or something.

Wait.

How do we know
that's really acid

and you didn't just have
someone's bones in there?

I mean, if you're doubting
if that's really acid

and not just jacuzzi-heated
Mountain Dew,

you're welcome
to use this ladle.

You think
I'm a goddamn idiot?

Brought my own.

Aah!

Oh, God!
Oh, God no!

Oh, God, no!
Oh, no -- Huh?

I'm acid-proof!

Fuck all of you,
fuck all of you,

I'm gonna be rich!

Here's my ass.

Take a good look,
spank it!

Acid proof!

Feels like that guy
had other stuff going on.

Don't ever
make fun of me again.

Ever!

Alright, c'mon Morty,
let's go home.

Wait, what?
This -- This isn't our reality?

What, you think
I'd waste our home

teaching you
a fucking lesson?

I am gonna miss
this place, though --

Johnny Carson's still alive
and on the air,

9/11 never happened,

and Rocky Road ice cream
has peanut butter

instead of marshmallows.The fu-- What?

The marshmallows
are the best part!

Morty...

Our next guest, ah, gave us,

well, actually,
very little information,

ah, besides the fact that he is,
uh, impervious to acid.

So here he is,
he's here to prove it.

Let's welcome this guy.

Let's do this shit!

Now, you're, uh --
you're sure about this?

Eat my ass!
Hoist me!

I did not know that ass
was on the menu.

Don't steal my moment!
Do it!


What? Oh!

Uh, yeah. He's by the johns.

Killing us won't bring her back!

Thanks for the info but I'm more

on a "revenge" kick
than a "results" kick.

You omitted key details

regarding tonight's mission.

Boy, I'm getting feedback
from every direction here.

Listen, you help me do my stuff.

Just shoot the me's
with sci-fi haircuts!

Some of us still have
Home Planets to protect.

And some of us do not.

We need to fight.

The impassive is
incapable of mercy.

I've got a pitch,

but we could also just
devolve into yelling.

If you know me -- and
it looks like you do --

you know you're dead.

I know why you haven't
pulled the trigger.

You're wondering
why I'm old and naked.

And you're about to wonder
why all your memories

before you met Bird Person
feel very generic and bird-themed.

Why was my 9th birthday
party in a pine tree?!

Don't take this badly -- You're
a memory of me assembled

by our best friend's mind,
and you're putting it together

because he
remembers you as smart.

Smart enough to know
that a memory can't do this.

He remembers you
shooting green holes

but not where they went.

So, what's my
deal? Am I sentient?

D-Do I have free will?

Who does? Who does?

Heyyy!

Yeah, just stopped in to whip
up a metacognition scanner

so I can track down BP's
fleeing consciousness

without enduring as much
Charlie Kaufman bullshit.

Cool. Time to save this cat.

I'm coming with,

now that I know
my life is a lie.

Wow. You really are 35.

Hey, look over there.

Then, together, we
will make our stand

at Blood Ridge.

What kind of feed do you like?

I enjoy grains,
though have, at times,

been called a seed man.

I've certainly
enjoyed your seed.

Don't be gross, Tammy.

Bird Person! It's me.

- Actual me, n-not a memory.
- I am aware.

Well, a-are you
aware you're in a coma

and you're gonna die if
you don't come with me?

Son of a --

Sorry. Just doing my job.

And loving it!

Oh, my God! Is
that Rick Sanchez?!

- Rick Sanchez!
- Sanchez!

- We hate that guy!
- You're bad!

Bucket was charmingly analog.

For a sec, you kinda
made me like myself.

You'll grow out of it. Let
me do this myself, okay?

Is your ego really so
fragile you won't take help

from an invincible
memory of yourself?

Ow!

Can we both die in here?

A-Are we damaging
our friend's brain?

I-I don't know any of the rules!

Rule 1 -- "All this can be
fixed unless I lose Bird Person."

Rules 2 through
50 -- "Don't die."

Okay, your benefit-to-cost
ratio is rising.

Young Memory Rick

and his All Too Real
Cautionary Tale from the Future!

Let's catch
ourselves a bird guy.

Who would high-five that,
you idealistic hipster douche?

Uh, is someone talking to me?

never formally met.

structure itself

its projects --

Oh-oh! Like -- Like
a -- Like a Jarvis.

Like -- Like Jarvis
in "Iron Man."

Who isn't? Yes. Absolutely.

are best friends.

Heh-heh. Whoa.

basic engineering

This is moving really fast.

So, he's just a
grumpy Scottish ogre?

And they made four of them?

Five by now, probably.

- M-Morty loves 'em.
- Morty?

Oh, uh, hypothetical grandson
we go on adventures with.

You're one of those
creeps who moves in

with abandoned adult Beths?

It's more complicated than that.

You live with a version
of our dead daughter.

- I-It had better be.
- Get off your high horse, Lone Ranger.

I'm you. Youwill go on to be me.

Yeah why do you
think I'm horrified?

I'd be fine walking
by this on the street.

I might even give it a dollar.

"This" is where you
being "this" leads.

You met me on my
way to save a very old,

very real friend after
a lifetime of reality.

I met you on your
way to a fairy tale

- at Blood Ridge.
- Wait, you're saying Blood Ridge goes bad.

We have a Vietnam?
That's fucking cool!

Why am I saving a
friend that remembers me

as this insufferable?

BP, where the
hell are you going?

Probably there.

Damn.

Wow, he's really taken
some drastic self inventory.

What do you think is down there?

If I had to guess, I'd say
we're near the memories

the Federation suppressed

when they resurrected
him as a cyborg.

- He might be here to unseal them.
- He was a Federation cyborg?

That means there might be
some juicy intel down there.

Ah, good idea. Let's
split up, and you go get it.

- What am I getting?
- I-I can't hear you

over the sound
of us spitting up!

For all your intelligence,

you seem unable to know
where you are wanted.

Buddy, this is not a safe
way to work on yourself.

At this point, I'd support
you joining Scientology.

I'll take the
workshops with you.

I'll get in a sauna
with Travolta --

I don't even care what happens.

- Let's get out of here.
- Don't you get it?

I came here to end it all.

I hope you didn't think
it'd be as easy as this.

I did not.

You were a good
friend, Rick. Goodbye.

Tammy?

- We gotta go.
- Did you just see that?

Yep. Not our biggest problem.

I take it you found BP?

The dude just blew his
mind, and not in a cool way

like he went to Blue Man Group.

- Can we still get him out?
- Maybe.

If you die in your friend's
brain, you die in real life.

We have until his
neural pathways erode.

Hold on. I need something first.

It's funny --

I always wondered who
would win if we ever fought.

Then you were
always a bad friend.

Your life isn't real,
and I didn't save it.

Take off all your clothes.

I knew this was how I'd die.

Whoa, oh!

- Can we still get him out?
- I think so.

B-BP went that way,
so we just have to --

Fuck! Find a different route.

We can make up
distance if we go deeper.

- Well, where's that go?
- Ugh.

That's the Battle
of Blood Ridge.

- That's our Vietnam!
- Your values are wrong!

This is the big show,
gentlemen and lady!

- Thank you!
- We're dropping into Blood Ridge,

one final chance to stop
the Federation offensive.

If we lose here --

All aboard! Hey don't mind us.

You guys are all
just a memory of war.

Don't tell them that!
They won't fight right.

I think it's best
if we ignore this.

Shit!

Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit!

Whoops, nope.

- Aw, this rules!
- No, it doesn't!

Neither does that!

Why would you not revisit this?

Oh, I don't know,
maybe, uh, the ending?

Yeah! Best friendship ever!

So, the rest of our life
is just more of that, right?

- T-T-That kicked ass!
- Let's move.

That set piece won't
stay put for long.

For real, that shit was
cash. Why would you not --

Damn. That shit was cash.

It was extremely bad ass.

The Battle of
Blood Ridge is over.

The Federation lost.

- I am in your debt.
- Come with me.

To somewhere... nearby?

Anywhere. E-Everywhere.

Rick, I don't expect
you to keep fighting,

but this war is --Far
from over, I know.

Dude, I share this with
almost nobody, but...

I could take you, right
now, to this same battlefield,

in a universe where we lost,
or another where we won,

or another where the
war never even happened.

All equally real,
all equally unreal.

None of it matters.

Then why did you help?

Because I respect you.

And I wanted you to
know you could respect me.

Even though nothing matters?

Okay.

Uh, the relationship that we
have... I never used that word!

...is not worth my
integrityOh, my God.

It's not a complicated
transaction, my man.

"Would you like to join me
doing awesome shit that matters?"

"No, I would not. I would
rather be a judgmental dork."

Case closed. Really
no need to drag it out.

If you need me, use the beacon.

Yeah, I'm gonna
use that beacon a lot.

I hope -- hope I
don't wear it out.

Okay, got it.

It wasn't the battle -that went wrong.
- Mm-hmm.

Why the fuck are you risking
your life for that asshole?

Because you love him.

You do, maybe. I don't.

Yeah, yeah. You're real cool.

Now come help me save his life

or fuck off, because
I don't need you.

Wow.

Does it ever get
any better than this?

No, Tammy. Trust
me, it does not.

Thank you for bringing
me here. It's so beautiful.

I got you, you
ungrateful piece of shit!

Rick, have you teamed up
with a memory of yourself?

I ask because that
would be deeply sad.

You don't get to tell
anyone what's sad, man.

You're like a one-man
Mount Sadmore.

So I guess like a
Lincoln Sadmorial.

Seriously. Time to go pal.

The closer you get to
complete neurocognital failure,

the more canon-y bullshit
is gonna try to kill us.

Is this a bad time to reveal
I'm an undercover officer?

Everyone knows. You're dead.

Fine.

Well, you're lucky my
fiancé remembers me as kind.

Eat my ass, BP. You're down
here bailing on the rest of us

because you don't want to
process your grief and shame

like a normal person by
drinking and mistreating strangers.

No, Rick, it is you who
must nibble my cloaca,

or "bird asshole."

Everyone knows what a cloaca is.

Sorry, but we do
not get to choose

- the ones we love.
- You got that right.

Why do you think I'm
still fucking down here?

I died at my wedding, Rick.

I am merely waiting
for it to take effect.

Are you gonna -tell him or what?
- I was getting to it!

I bet she didn't even
tell you about the kid!

- I am sorry?
- About the what?

Was wondering when
you were gonna --

I think I'd know if I had a kid.

You're a memory. You
know what he knows.

And he doesn't know because
an army of Brainalyzer protocols

walled off any memories
post-Phoenix Person.

Oh, my God.
Operation Blahblahblah!

Well, because I wouldn't
know the name of it.

Tammy, if there were a child...

Their father would
be a terrorist.

They'd be a fugitive
or... contained.

Listen, if you won't
live for yourself,

live for the half-Bird
Person, half-Megabitch

that's eatin' worms
on a prison asteroid.

I have made a decision.

I would now like to live.

Perfect timing.

- You drive.
- Just always been cool, I guess.

Shit! The bridge is out!

His mind is collapsing!

You thought we could
take the same route back?

You don't get to lecture
me about memory bullshit!

You've known about
it for all of half an hour!

Then don't -be an idiot!
- This is your best friend?

He is a complicated -individual.
- Someone else drive!

BP, remember the
night Jerry caught us

peeing on his begonia patch,

and I used that gun
to erase his memory?

- Vaguely.
- Gotta hope vaguely works.

If I'm right, you
remembering that means

you also remember the device.

Look for any
memories of my garage!

God. I hope one's still up.

- Aww! The night we met.
- Gross!

- On my workbench?
- Squanchy used the --

That's what some
closets are for!

C'mon, I'm really counting

on your attention
to detail here.

This is what you
remember from my lab?

You would prefer I
keep mental inventory

- of your stuff?
- Yes!

Rick Sanchez,
you're under arrest

for making me spend two
years in Earth high school!

Go! Go! Go!

We'll have to do

some creative memory
shit to get out of here.

The exit's when we
met at Birding Man

and did Senthol Diempathate.

- Damn, a great time.
- Exactly, it's too happy.

There won't be a
clean path to get there.

We'll need to build one
with memories of mine

and lily-pad our way up.

Wh-What related
memories do we share

heavy on anger and sadness?

Geardude's funeral?

Oh, that was sad.

Gearitus Sanctis--

They're memories.
Just run them over.

- They're not real!
- Hey!

Wait, is that Gearhead?

We were freedom fighters
with his older brother.

Hugely important context.

You thought we hung
out with him for fun?

We need one more
bridge to the festival.

What's here? People in suits.

Sad catered lunch.
Newly single widows.

Something performance based?

Squanchy's very
distasteful eulogy.

Squanchy's terrible
standup phase.

That's it!

Down that way!

So you know when
you're squanching,

and she just gets real in there,

y'know that real nasty squanch?

Who are you -- What is --

Oh, my God. I'm a memory!

We just sat through all
that standup for nothing!

Almost out!

Okay, listen everybody.
My name's Rick.

This is my new friend
Bird Man and his friends.

We all just met
at this festival,

and we're so high,
we formed a band!

As if I'd ever let
you escape me.

Eh, living's overrated.

Hey!

Remember me!

No, fuck! We were even!

You got a pretty
cool memory of me.

Go-time, pal. Might
be time to do the thing.

I'm sorry for killing you

and turning you into
a cyborg, apparently.

I really did love you.

I loved you, too.

Goodbye, Tamantha.

Come on, man. I feel ridiculous!

Thank you for not
giving up on me.

Great. You can pay me
back literally right now.

Holy shit! Wow. Holy shit!
We almost didn't make it.

Jesus fuck! That was
close. That was insane.

Oh, my God. That
thing with the thing!

Thank you, Rick.
Wait, wait, wait.

Lemme hop back over to my body.

We're back, baby!

Rick and Bird Person,
a hundred years!

Whaddya think, tie this
one off -by tying one on?

- Not tonight.

I have, as you say,

"parenting shit" to deal with.

Right, yeah.
Welcome to the club.

Don't, uh... Don't clone it

and send one of
the two into space --

I guess they really hate that.

Whup, I think Memory
Rick ditched Evil Tammy

and snuck back
over into my brain.

I have a pubescent memory
of my older self in my closet.

Gotta deal with that
-- That could get ugly.

Rick, I do not like
to pull threads.

it is a disruptive
and feline activity.

But I must ask. It's
fine. You don't have to --

Was there really a second

in there where you
knew about my child,

but chose not to inform me
on the chance I might then

grow too busy child
rearing to hang out?

Oh. Uh...

Weird way to thank me
for discovering your kid.

You did not know of the child
when you came to rescue me,

and once aware,
refrained from sharing

until necessary
to save yourself.

Fair enough.

I will see you when I see you.

W-Wait, what? But you said --

thing to happen,

all his energy storage devices.

Nah, I get it.

Just babysitting.

That and modelling
my new pantyhose

in plain view of
the living room.

Honestly the kid could
come watch. I'd welcome it.

This cultural time period's
cool like that, y'know?

It's -- It's -- It's -- It's
not what it looks like!

It looks like you
propagated yourself
What are you doing?!

Dad?

Dad?
Hello?

What is wrong
with you?

Really?

Oh.
Okay.

Mornin', assholes.

What's this?
Pancakes?

Sold.
What was up with you
last night?

I was totally talking to you and
you acted like I wasn't there.

I did? Oh, yeah. No.
That wasn't me.

Technically.
That was my night person.

Been having him do crunches
while I sleep. Check it.

Damn!
Check out that washboard, yo!

Hey.
Too hard.

What the hell's
a night person?

I nabbed a Somnambulator
while passing

through the Goobie-Joob System
last week.

Best investment I've ever made.

Before going to bed, I type a
list of shit I want to get done.

Then the Somnambulator programs
my unconscious body,

or "night person,"
to do it while I sleep.

I'm getting so much done.

C-Can my night person get me
an ab stack like yours, Rick?

I'm gonna have my night person
learn me Spanish

so I can pass my test
next week!

Hey, hey, hey. No one gets
a night person but me.

Aw!
This tech is way too advanced
for you zeebs.

What?
Nothing.

No. Go on.
Say it.

Say what? I don't know
what you're talking about.

Okay! Fine!
Fuck it!

Everybody gets a night person.
Whatever.

Stick out your fingers.
It needs a blood sample.

Blood? Can't I just give it
Beth's credit card number?

This isn't Postmates, Jerry.

The Somnambulator needs
your DNA profile

to send commands
to your subconscious.

It can poke all the fingers
I got if I get abs like Rick.

Well, looks like I'm learning
the trumpet.

Okay. Remember, somebody
has to catch me if I faint.

Yay!
Night family!

Whoo!

Oh.
I'm fainting.

Hola, mamá.
¿Como lo llevas?

How's my honor student
doing?

Muy bien.

All the niños and niñas
at school

think I should run
for class presidenta.

'Sup, ladies.
Want to see somethin'?

Summer, you want to drop
this bowling ball on my abs?

Hell, yeah.
I'm only human.

Watch this.

'Sup, ladies. You ready, Morty?
The stream's about to go live.

Where are you two going?

Morty and I started a podcast
we call "FAB-solutely AB-ulous."

It's -- It's an ab-centric hour
of fun.

Hoping to get Nancy Pelosi
on the show next week.

Want to drop her
on our abs!

Yeah!

Guess who has
a new pen pal!

No takers?

It's me!
Pen pal?

Night Jerry and I
write letters to each other.

It's super fun.

"I also like Tori Amos."
"Hope you like our new pajamas."

"What is the sun?"

Jerry, this isn't how you're
supposed to use a night person.

You two are being a couple
of Debbie Down-theres.

Wait until Night Jerry reads
about this.

Who wants cake?

Abs are cool.
Way cool.

But as above, so below.
Know what I'm sayin', Rick?

Morty, you must be referring
to these excellent boxer shorts

we got from the good folks
at Boxer Lobster.

Boxer Lobster Boxers feel like
they're warm butter

on your schwantz.

And they come in all sorts
of styles --

neon, plaid, orange.

I-I even got a pair
with that little, uh --

the raccoon man from that
one movie, uh, printed on it.

Chewbacca.
Do yourself a favor

and level up
with Boxer Lobster Boxers.

You'll be glad you did.

Oh, shit,

Rick, they want you to say
"Wub-a-lubba-dub-dub"

at the end.
Screw that.
We're not whores.

Guys, dinner's getting cold.

You know
what's not getting cold?

This hot stack
of ab-jacks, son.

Pow! Pow! Pow!
Pow! Pow! P-Pow!

Pow! Pow! Pow! Pow!
Pow! Pow!

Pow! Pow! Pow! Pow!
P-Pow!

No notes.
Oh! One more thing.

Night Jerry said Night Summer
would appreciate it

if everybody could rinse off
their plates after eating.

What?

You know, rinse the schmutz off
after eating.

Makes it easier
to clean up later.

What?

Our job is not to make the
night people's chores easier.

It's a reasonable request, Rick.
Takes two seconds.

They exist only to do
the shit we don't want to do.

So until further notice,
which will be never...

...request denied.

Hello there.

What the cock?
Where are the dishes?

Uh, Dad?
They're in here.

They busted up
all our dishes!

What are we supposed to eat off
of now, brains-for-shit?

You owe me.

We'll eat off these...

"brains-for-shit."

Seems like you spent
an awful lot of energy

just to not give the
Night family what they want.

Jerry tell your boyfriend
to suck my dick

and good luck breaking
super alien dishes.

I'll let him know,
but he's not gonna like it.

What?

Why won't you rinse your dishes?

It takes two seconds.

If you don't, the schmutz dries

and makes the dish
harder to clean.

Rinse your dishes!

Rinse!
Rinse!Rinse!

Rinse!

Let me go!
Who locked my implants?

I told
you to after you fell asleep.

You see,
night you is not in charge.

Night I...am.

Pft! I don't care.
I ain't rinsing shit. Hey!

W-What are you doing?

If you refuse to clean
your dishes...

then I will have to do it
for you.

Unh-unh! Unh-unh-unh!
Unh-unh!

I have always been here,
Rick,

deep inside the mind
of your grandchild,

waiting to come out.

Your machine allowed me
to steal the night.

And soon...
I will seize the day.

Oh!
Baby Jesus!

Oh, it's awful!

Oh, Baby Jesus!
Awful!

What the fuck
is your problem with me?

What? What? I don't know
what you're talking about!

I just got force-fed diarrhea
by your night person,

who's also convinced night me
to lock me out of my tech.

Uh, Rick?

There's been a pretty clear
escalation down here.

The night family
stripped the house last night.

Everything's gone,
including the Somnambulator!

They locked us
out of the garage.

Don't know about you,
but I got the hoo-ha's.

God damn it!
Are you happy now, Summer?

I didn't do anything.

I'm trapped
in this bullshit, too.

Yeah.
Glad you think so.

Because I got a plan
to beat Night Summer --

You're going undercover.

Did you have to make
mushy garbage science

on the living-room carpet?
Yeah. No choice, Jerry.

Night Summer had Night Rick
take away my tech.

Had to improvise.

There are different levels
of cortisol in your bloodstream

when you're asleep,
so this interface

only works off my awake
saliva samples --

Naghh.

There.

No one asleep will be able
to deactivate the laser cage

until I win.
W-Where's Summer?

Never mind her. All of you --
Get to bed.

Ugh! it itches. This whole thing
is way uncomfortable.

Yeah, that's the idea.

The Sleep Deprivation Suit
is designed

to keep you awake
until morning.

Uh, aren't they
going to be suspicious

seeing Night Summer covered
in all this Terry Gilliam?

They're not gonna
question her.

She's the leader of the night
family for some stupid reason.

When the night family activates,
just blend in.

Make them think
you're Night Summer.

If you start to nod off,
suck on this tube.

What is it?

A cocktail of Mountain Dew
and DayQuil.

The kids in Southern Europe
call it DewQuil.

Smells gross.
It is.

Once you find the Somnambulator,
use this Deactivator Puck.

Stick it on the Somnambulator,
and when the puck activates,

it'll fry its circuits.

Remember --
stay awake all night.

Meet me back here
at sunrise.

Why are you wearing that suit?

- Mm.
- Yes.

Yes.
Why?

Yeah.

Because you're all
such clothing experts.

That's fair.
Ouch.

- Fair enough.
- Point taken.

Get back to work.

I rule the night...
and stuff.

Yes.
Okay.

Will do.
As you wish.

Grandpa Rick!
Rick, wake up!

Wha-- I'm up!
I'm up!

D-Did you find it?
For sure.

You were souping up
that Somnambu-whatever

so they could extend its range
beyond the house.

But I defeated that shit

when I put the thing
on top of the thing.

Everybody, wake up!
Summer fried the Somnambulator!

The nightmare is over.
Really? Oh!

That's amazing!
Almost got pinched, but yeah.

Say adiós to the night family.

Bye-bye, pen pal.

I want Shoney's pancakes!

Yes!
Shoney's pancakes!

All right!
Brunch is on me, day family --

Naghh.

You know, for a second there,

I thought Night Summer
was gonna win.

That chick is
the absolute worst.

Sorry, Rick, but your opinion
means very little to me.

Did you think you
could stop me with this, Rick?

Halt, daymanoids!

Everyone get behind
my abs!

Do not move!
Do not move!

You are most definitely
surrounded.

You are the slaves now.

If you have any doubt...
I suggest you sleep on it.

She's Night Summer!

Thanks, Jerry.

Work! Work!

The function of the daymanoid
is to serve the night!

Work harder!
Harder!

It is natural
for the day to serve the night.

Night was here
long before day.

Half of all time
is nighttime.

One hundred and fifty-seven.
Ooh!

One hundred
and fifty-eight.

One hundred and --
No more, please!

I hate exercise!
Silence!

Crunch harder!
Harder!

We have to escape
the Somnambulator's reach.

Do we even know
how far that is?
No.

Cards on the table, we may be
really F'ed in the A this time.

Uh, report to your designated
sleep pod for rest period.

Ooh-ee.

I am a friend
of your son-in-law.

Come with me.

How?
Huh?
Hurry.

We don't have long before
the proxy drones go back online.

Oh, thank you,
Night Jerry.

Anything to help
Day Jerry's family.

He's a very special per--

Oh! Hey!
Ow! Why?

Nice.
You got our Jerry back.

Uh, yeah.
Totally why I did that.

Everybody
in Rick's car!

No, no, no, no, Morty!
Wait!

Having a bit a trouble
with your car, Sanchez?

- Not now, Gene!
- Halt!

Daymanoids are restricted
from the outside world!

Halt!
Halt!

Hold on to your tits.

Where am I going?
To the airport!

We have to get as far away as
possible from the Somnambulator

before we fall asleep.
W-What about Summer?

W-We can't leave her behind!

She's not your sister anymore,
Morty. Consider her dead.

Eat shit, Summer!

Sweetie, you got to shake
those robots.

I think we lost them!

Son of a bitch!

Damn it, we lost Morty!

Aah!
Beth! Watch out!

You cannot esca--

"complete their task."

Was I one of those guys?

The difference is you didn't
disappear afterwards.

Well...

I got you pregnant.

Yeah...

What the hell happened
to this place?

Uh, your Meeseeks Box happened.

They went crazy when they
couldn't take two strokes off

Jerry's golf game.

He felt terrible.

Hey, it's not my fault
that Jerry's an idiot.

Dad!

Is there anything you can
do to clean this place up?

Well, you know, I do
have a fleeseeks box.

No. No more boxes.

What?

It just has a mop and
some floor wax in it.

Wubba lubba dub dubs!

[ LAUGHTER ]

Yeah! That's my new thing!

I'm kind of like
what's his name...

Ar-Arsenio.

Isn't that... it's what Arsenio
used to say on his show.

Wobble gobba lop bops!
Right?

See you next week, everybody.

I don't get it.

[ RAPID FOOTSTEPS ] [ PANTING ]

Sir, I think you're going
to want to see this.

We found it inside a lockbox
inside King Jelly Bean's closet.

[ RETCHES ]

We have to tell the people.

Wait.

Destroy it.

Our people will get more from
the idea he represented than

from the Jelly Bean
he actually was.

Did you get any of that?

It's a good-a show!

﻿And in weird things in space
news,

that mysterious "rift"
is still there.

Not gone yet.
You remember that, don't you?

It's probably important.

Back to you, Tabitha.

Rick, Mom's working,
and Dad's still sleeping.

I'm -- I'm --
I'm gonna be late.

Yeah, yeah.
I-I got you.

Here.
Holy shit.

I-Is the portal gun
working again?

Yeah, pretty much.

Sometimes that happens.

Just get the keys.

It's actually been nice
taking a break

from
the portal travel stuff.

I-I've been racking up a lot
of high-school adventures.

I have a process, Morty.
Huh?

I'm fixing my portal gun,
and every time you bring it up,

it blocks
my creative flow.

A-And then I'm forced
to take longer on purpose

just to train you
to not bring it up.

Geez. Do you know
what "projection" is?

Do you?
No.

I-I-I heard Mom use it.

Lord, no.
He's here again?

Morty protocol, children.

Oh, what's it now?

Brain bugs?
Space worms?

Have I been
"The Faculty'd" again?

You guys don't have to react
like this every day.

Last time, the aliens made me
lick all the toilet seats.

That's right --
made me.

I see that look
on your faces.

What did you do,
ya tiny monster?

This isn't me.

The people demand to know --

Do these visitors come in peace?

But first,
"Peter's Pizza Corner."

What slice we reviewing
today, Petey?

Cheese.

If these aliens want Earth,

they'll have to go
through Egypt.

And they can ask mummies
how that goes.

Mummy mia!

Dinosaurs are back?

Monkeys went bald?

Shh!

Before we start...

where are the rest of...

us?

Uh...

They died. Uh...

Long time ago.

Way before us.
We didn't see nothin'.

But surely our ancestors must
have left some evidence behind.

Why is he nervous?

Because, uh,
you're dinosaurs.

It's weird.

Thought you were dead.

Moving on, we "dinosaurs"
evolved here on Earth

until our technology
was planetarily harmonic.

That being the goal

with technology.

After we achieved perfect
balance with Mother Earth,

our best and bravest left
to help other planets.

Over millions of years,
we've called many worlds home

and helped
each one flourish.

Imagine our surprise
upon returning home

to find our species extinct
and Earth now in the care of...

you guys.

When we left,
you were basically squirrels.

Well, uh,
we've come a long way,

and we -- We've buried
a lot more than nuts.

We've evolved past
nonconstructive criticism,

so let's agree
you've done your best.

You're still alive.

But surely there was some point
between gunpowder

and something called
Amazon Prime

that you folks
had to think,

"Are we supposed to be
running a planet?

Wouldn't we rather make...

Marvel movies?"

How many Marvel movies
have you made?

29,
and 14 more on the way.

See, you love doing that.

And we love helping new
life-forms get their footing.

So now that we're back, we can
respectfully take it from here.

Now, hold on.
If you've seen "Endgame,"

you know invasion
is not something

Earth takes lying down.

This is not an invasion.

Besides, wouldn't you like
to lie down?

Ugh.
You must be exhausted.

Put your feet up,
get more tattoos,

finish rounding out
this "Ant-Man" character.

Think of it like your Earth
concept of "vacation,"

except permanent.

I think I speak
for all world leaders

when I say that the poor people
would just murder us

if we made you leave,
so...

welcome home, dinosaurs.

Oh.
I could use a vacation.

Should we nuke them?
I'm on vacation, Curtis.

Well, you leaned into this
fast.

Zuniceratops

Elvisaurus

Bambiraptor

Erectopus

Dracorex hogwartsia

Gojirasaurus

Vulcanodon

Sauroniops

Phuwiangosaurus

Those are
real dinosaur names

Ugh. I can't even pretend
to feel useful in a game.

This is how humanity's
story ends?

Relieved of duty and sat
at the kids' table?

I gotta respect
these dinosaurs.

They dominated
a whole species

just by calling its bluff
about wanting more free time.

They didn't even dominate us

because we're not worth
a fight to them.

We've become
biological Tyler Perry movies.

All they've done is help.
We didn't need their help.

We were not the problem.

This house recycles.

They sort it at
the trash facility.

What the "F"?
My dance videos

are getting,
like, zero likes now.

Oh, yeah. The dinos
kicked pedophiles off TikTok.

Great.
So now I'm broke?

You don't need money
anymore.

So what's this for
now?

Phone calls? Ugh.

Oh, c'mon, Dad.
You don't hate this, too?

Why would I? I-I was
already doing what I wanted.

I do think
it's kind of funny

that you're all basically
Jerry now.

Fuck.

Jerry,
how do you do it?

-Yeah, Dad, how do you do it?
-How do you do it, Dad?

- Huh?
- How do you do it?

It's finally happened.

All right.

Does anyone know how to
mail things to publishers?

Uhp.
President only pages me

if it's an emergency
or he needs Molly.

I'm sure glad
you stayed open, Beau.

Wish we could pay,

but no more capitalism.

I never make ribs
for the money, Mr. President.

Oh, um, here ya go.

That's not why I called.

Drugs can't solve
this problem.

I can't live
like this anymore.

At first it was fun
spending all day

watching whatever
YouTube autoplays

after the last
one autoplayed,

but a man can only watch
so many ads for Grammarly.

Rick. Please.

You're not bound
by morality.

Get rid of them.
Slit their necks.

Zero Dark Thirty these fuckers
for the good of the species.

I won't tell.
Help us go back to the old days,

where we pretend to fix
the problems we caused.

You think
I'm gonna side with you

over
hyper-intelligent creatures

operating way beyond
your comprehension?

I have more in common
with them than you.

You pompous
autistic cadaver!

You think you're above this?
I ought to...

Look here, Mr. President.

When I need my ribs
to be tender and delicious,

I pamper them.

See, if you give someone
what they want,

they'll give you
what you need.

I'm jus' saying.

I see your point, Beau.

All right, Rick.
Ha ha.

Name your price.

-Aw, crap.
-God damn it.

How often are you
"Westworld-ing" me?

Hang on. Rib-tips jammed
his folk-chip again.

Ol' reliable Rick.

Always k-knows what to do.

What do you want, Rick?
Trustworthy.

I won't stoop to answering
that again.
Honest.

You know exactly what I want.

I can't just snap my fingers
and get you that job.

Yeah, yeah.
Thanks for lunch.

Fine. Fine!

If you get rid
of the dinosaurs...

you can host the Oscars.

Yes!
Righteous R-Rick.

Straight shootin',
t-truth-tellin',

never wets the bed.

Goodbye, old friends.

May you rest in peace,
