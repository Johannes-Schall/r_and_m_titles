[ CAMERA SHUTTERS CLICKING ]

Good afternoon.

I know all of you are wondering

about the condition
of our dear, beloved Pibbles.

Which would you prefer between
the XP-20 and the XP-20 XS?

I prefer my own penis,
and so should you!

The brave Earth man
whose sacrifice

is going to allow
Shrimply Pibbles to live...

Mr. Jerry Smith.

[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]

Hello, everyone!

Let's hear it again
for Shrimply Pibbles, huh?

He's a good guy, isn't he?

I've only just been learning
about his accomplishments,

from his march
on Flirk Blirk Square

to his ongoing battle
with heroin dependency.

He's the best.

[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]

Um, yeah.

Well, I-it occurs to me
that his heroin addiction

may not have been
a matter of public record.

You realize heroin makes up
10% of the atmosphere

on Shrimply Pibbles'
home planet.

His planet was destroyed
by Clorgon death squads.

He can't live outside of it
without breathing heroin.

Right. I know that.
I just think...

This guy's trying to get out of
giving away his penis!

[ CROWD SHOUTING ]

NARRATOR:
Today on "How They Do It"...

Plumbuses.

Everyone has a plumbus
in their home.

First, they take the dinglebop,

and they smooth it out
with a bunch of schleem.

The schleem is then repurposed
for later batches.

They take the dinglebop,

and they push it
through the grumbo,

where the fleeb
is rubbed against it.
The point of a talking cat
is to have fun.

I find the insinuation that
I can't ask questions

andhave fun
condescending.

Y-You find it
condescending, Jerry?Yes.

- All right. I'm from outer space. Happy?
- No.

Exactly, because no answer
would be satisfying.

Because it's a lie.

Let's see the truth.

What in the...

Oh, son of a bitch.

Jerry, don't.I want to see.

No, you do not.

No, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no!

At least now maybe --

Get the hell out of here!

But I've got
nowhere to go.

Get out!
Get out!

Get out!

He was in my home where
I keep photos of my parents.

Jerry, I have a device.

I-It can make us forget.

No, I don't think we should
forget,

not this.

Someone
has to remember.

Someone will.

Did we crash?

Where's the cat?

He, uh, ran away.

Did you scan his brain?Yeah.

Did you find out
why he can talk?

He's from outer space.

Outer space?

That little --

Of course, total mind fuck.

Now, that's what I call
draggin'.

What?
It's a joke.

You're a dragon
draggin' your stuff.

I understand.

So, how you doing?

I grow weary
of you humans.

How about 50 bucks?
You weary of 50 bucks?

but I wanted to hear the rest.

Do you have any thoughts? Notes?

No. I-I just enjoyed it.

That's my note, you know?
Please write more.

- Seems a little insincere.
- What? No.

You don't have
to mollycoddle me.

I want to improve my writing.
Tell me your real thoughts.

All right. Well, um,
I'm not a huge fan, personally,

of the whole "three weeks
earlier" teaser thing.

I feel like, you know,

we should start our stories
where they begin

not start them
where they get interest...

- Get out.
- Um, what?

No, I'm sick of this.
You bang on my door,

you beg me to help you, I share
something personal with you,

and you take a giant shit on it.

Hey, man, we asked
if we could put up a beacon...

Well, you can't.
I want you out of here.

You're a petty person,
and you're insecure,

and you're taking it out on me.
That's a good script.

What the hell?!

I don't care. I want you out.

- What?
- Take that thing down.

Your grandson
is a shitty person. Leave now.

- Morty!
- Rick, I didn't do anything.

I sat through
his entire screenplay...

You "sat through it"?

Yes! Did you want me
to weep with joy?

- It's terrible!
- Whoa Morty! We're guests here.

I tried to be a good guest!
He dragged it out of me!

- I'm taking down this beacon.
- No, stop! That's not fair!

Just because
you hate your own writing

doesn't make me a bad person!

Aah!

You like that? You want me
to cut to three weeks earlier

when you were alive?

RICK: Whoa, Morty.
You just purged.


- and terminate the program.
- Terminate? They're alive, Dad.

And at some
point, they won't be,

That's how existing works.

W-W-What, are you
gonna save every stray cat?

No, but I can resist making
more of them in a lab.

Gah, look! Save the empathy.

It's more termite infestation
than "Blade Runner" --

I still think we're decoys.

You just want an
excuse to stop trying.

Yeah. And?

Oooh. There's a handsome fellow.

Uh-oh.

I thought you made
them harmless.

I don't remember
making this one.

Oh, hi, Rick. Family, me?

Hey, when did you all leave?

Analysis Mode. 8-0-0-8-5.

Hmm? N-Nothing, buddy.

You-you gotta stop
with all that coffee.

It's making you loopy.

H-Happy Analysis Mode.

Happy Analysis Mode to you, too!

Think you got the
wrong house, bro.

about the decoys!

They were my idea!

What?! Hide!

Wow. Like -- Like "Ex Machina."

Yes, Morty, like "Ex Machina."

But don't fuck them.
- Summer! Whatever, weirdo.

I'm gonna see how
wrong you got my room.

So you do know what a
loving family looks like.

A simulated one, yes.

- Why are we hiding?
- He thinks he's me,

and I was about to
start terminating decoys.

- But we're not decoys.

Our planet was taken over

It absorbed

Which gives me pleasure.

Wow. It's Coat Rack Head.

But, like, if we offend you,

isn't that good?

Big time, yeah, duh. I loved it.

So painful, and
therefore, so pleasurable.

Yeah, go on in.

Rick, Beth, you
love me after all!

Eh, I love her, she loves you.

Those credits don't transfer.

Ah, Rick, we were so
hoping you'd come down here

so we could come down here.

We're here to rescue Jerry.

No, you're here 'cause
we want you here.

Mm, excellent.

Ooh, that hurts, which
means it feels good.

Um... Dad?

Don't you see, Rick?

Jerry was just bait.

The two of you --
you're a package deal.

What the hell are
you talking about?

You think Jerry is
lame and you're cool,

but the lamest thing
of all is thinking that.

The two of you combined

is what we call the
lamest thing ever!

Oh, no. No!

Well, well, well,
table for surprised,

party of me.

Ugh. Yes, see?

Cringe cannot exist in a vacuum.

It needs to be observed.

Skin hooks! Hook our guests!

Nice hooks. Where-Where'd
you get them?

- Aah!
- Didn't I say replace those goddamn hooks?

I forgot! Which makes
me embarrassed.

Which makes me proud!

Goddammit.

It's time for you three

to finally feel our full wrath.

Oh, you'd love that, right?


Crazy and of --
of course soul-crushing.

For you. I actually have
something for that.

Y-You want some?
They're nonaddictive.

That's not true.
They're totally addictive.

I'm a terrible doctor.

I actually have something
for that, too.

You want some?
Nonaddictive. Mmm.

I'm a great doctor.

Dr. Wong had
a cancellation today.

Anybody up for
a family session?

- I could do that.
- I'm -- I'm down to clown.

Ooh, not sure my therapy puppet
will be done in time.

Great, because she
specifically asked you

to stop bringing puppets.
Dad?

I love therapy, family therapy
most of all,

but I am actually
disintegrating.

Oh, my God!Whoa! Dad!

Is that really it?
We did it?

It's the invisibility belt.

Whoa-whoa-whoa!
He grazed them.

That's gonna hurt
in like 10 seconds.

Thanks, Morty.Why should I let you use it?

You never let me use it.Can I have the belt?

It would really piss off Morty.Fantastic idea.

What the hell?!
You jerk! Give it!

Hey! Ow!

Share the invisibility.
Jerry?

Ooh, this looks like a job
for Mr. Nibbles.

Let me just glue
one more eye on.

I'm gonna kill you!

Woof.
Looks like you two have to fight

about why you can't
control your kids.

Good thing Dr. Wong's
got an opening.

- You're a bad father.

Don't let him divide us.

Garage, family therapy mode.

Ah.

What do you [BURPS] what do you

think of this
flying vehicle, Morty?

I built it out of stuff
I found in the garage.

Yeah, Rick, it's...
it's great.

Is this the surprise?

Morty, I had to...
I had to do...

I had to...
I had to...

I had to make a bomb, Morty.

I had to create a bomb.

What?! A bomb?!

We're gonna drop
it down there...

Just get a whole
fresh start, Morty.

Create a whole fresh start.

T-t-that's
absolutely crazy!

Come on, Morty.
Just take it easy, Morty.

It's gonna be good.

Right now, we're gonna go pick
up your little friend Jessica.

Jessica?

From my math class?

When I drop the bomb, I don't...

You know, I want you to have
somebody,

you know...
I want you to have the thing...

I'm gonna make it like
a new Adam and Eve,

and you're gonna be Adam.

[ GROANS ]

And Jessica's gonna be Eve, and
so that's the surprise, Morty.

No, you can't!

J-Jessica doesn't
even know I exist.

But... but... but
forget about that,

because you can't
blow up humanity.

i-i get what you're trying
to say, m-morty.

Listen, I'm not...
you don't...

y-y-you don't got to worry about
me trying to fool around with...

with Jessica or mess around
with Jessica or anything.

I'm... I'm not that
kind of guy, Morty.

What are you talking
about, Rick?

You... you... you don't
have to worry about me getting

with Jessica or anything.

Whoa. Hot weapons.

right they're hot.

Yo, man, Chet's party is
jumping off at Space Tahoe.

Yeah. Look, I
gotta scoot, but...

I'd love to see what you look
like when you Changeform,

so maybe come by Space Tahoe

and we can get to
know each other.

Peace.

You totally like
that guy, don't you?

And what? That means
you don't have feelings?

Listen, it takes a
Chutback to know one.

You got all this power,
but what good is it

if you don't even
know who you are?

Yeah, but he's
pretending to be a car.

Why can't you pretend to be
a robot pretending to be a car?

- Okay, Bruce, good effort.
- Hit the showers. Wait.

tell Rick about tonight...

You have virginity?

Not mine.

Never fucked a doorknob.

And that was the third time

he shit his pants from
eating too much soup.

To be fair,

it was cold outside
and the soup was warm.

Another luscious tale, Beth.

A transcendent
addition to guys' night.

What do you expect? I
mean, she's my wi-i-i-i-fe!

Come on, Morty.

What are you doing in here?

I'm trying to find
our weed whacker,

'cause our weeds are wack, yo.

But you can't go in the garage
when Rick's not here.

I "can't"?

- Well, he doesn't like it.
- What's he gonna do?

Crash rent-free
at his other family's house?

BETH: What is that
supposed to mean?

all over us

because of
your abandonment issues.

He's playing you, shorty.

Oh, stop affecting
that stupid hip-hop dialect.

Stop shifting the cross hairs
to my ironic urban patois

with your father

is to' up from the flo' up.

this world will be invited
into the Galactic Federation.

Oh, goody.

From there, I'll have access to

countless planets and species.

I will become the universe,

and I will be what

want this to happen?

And either tell her
you want to stay married

or get on with your life,
but whatever you do,

stop being a baby

through to something here.

- Leave?

or we are enemies.

- Aah!
- Aah!

Now Iwill fight you.

Anyway, he tells a different
version of the story

where I start crying
or something.

That's why he has to die.

'Cause he's a liar.

So...

why are you going to kill
Rick Sanchez?

Okay, I don't know
who that is.

I don't accept your weird
leap in logic

that has everyone on a train
going to kill one guy.

And even if I did,
why would we take turns

telling stories
about it like

little girls
at a sleepover?

If you're trying
to be hurtful,

you're doing a good job.

I'll take his turn.

Here's why I'm going
to kill Rick Sanchez.

You guys have fun
with this.

Dissolve to
a clam-shaped sun

rising over
a giant beach.

Whew.

By then, of course,
he had left toys

and flesh drops for every
one of us in the spore-hive.

Ah, a newcomer!

I suppose you think you have
a better story

about how Rick Sanchez
saved Space Christmas.

What is with
the Rick Sanchez obsession?

to answer that

is with my
Christmas Rick Tale.

Whoo!

But there's always been 10.

that I wrote this number down

means that
there's four parasites.

You sure about that, Rick?

Begging your pardon,

but I seem to recall
a great deal of confusion

surrounding that number.

I guess that is what happened,

but I-I don't get
why I would do that.

can go save Rick.

about that!

ideas, Rick,

and you act like they're
not even worth thinking about!

the helicopter lawn chair?

That's just something
you saw on TV.

What about my video-game-style

Oh, my God,
here we go.

It's a good idea, Rick!
A device that lets you --

Save your place
like in a video game

but in real life
so that you can try stuff

and then go back
to your save point,

yes, Morty,
I saw it on "Futurama."

Oh, so you don't do anything
unless it's original?

I don't do
time travel.

It's not time travel,
it's saving a place in time --

Oh, my God,
is this what you think I do?

This is where the heavy lifting
happens in your mind?

Do you have any idea
how much fucking work

would have to go into
a machine that --

Ah-ha!
You can't do it!

I can do anything,
Morty.

Your idea
is not worth doing.

You can't do it.

Before what you're trying to do
was called "negging,"

it was called
"reverse psychology,"

and incels didn't invent it,
Bugs Bunny did.

You can't do it.There is nothing
I cannot do.

- Just say you can't do it!
- I won't!

have done this for us?

We are not them!

We are not... them.

[ BARKS ]

I've made a decision.

will lead to nothing but more heartbreak,

more cruelty.

Instead, we will go to a new
world and colonize it with a

society of intelligent dogs...

one that will not make the same
mistakes as humanity and one

where pet insurance
will be mandatory.

I wonder what it'll
be like, Rick.

I think it will be great, Morty.

You know, it's g... i-i-i-i-it
could be developed in-into a

for people of all ages.

- Yeah!

about a thousand memories

of your dumb, little ass and
about six of them are pleasant.

The rest is annoying garbage.

So why don't you do us both

be missing classes.

you mean by that.

Can... can... can you be a

sex-positive lately.

- Eww.
- Dr. Wong suggested we experiment.

We've been watching
pornography. Together.

- Gross!
- I might never come back from the ocean.

Oh, you'll have to
tone it down, babe.

The squares can't handle it.

There are suicide
capsules in all of your teeth.

Do what you want with that.

C'mon, Morty.
You're on booze duty.

Okay, Nimbus only
drinks the good shit.

So just toss this whale-ass
ocean-wine in here

and age it up a few centuries.

So time moves faster in there?

I-I-Is it like a Narnia thing?

I'm not a beaver who
believes in Jesus Christ, Morty.

But yeah, it's pretty
much a Narnia thing.

Okay, but Jessica --All you
have to do is bring wine, Morty.

When do I ask you -for anything?
- When do you --

I haven't been to a full
week of school in years!

I don't know shit! And for what?

How many enemies
do you have to have?

Why is everything
a fight with you?

You might want to
learn this early, Morty.

- Life is a fight.
- With Mr. Nimbus?

Are you makin' fun of me?

Mr. Nimbus is an
ice-cold dick killer, Morty.

Okay, let's go. That's

I yearn for a
taste of his cringe.

His delicious lack of awareness,

paired with an oafish
need to be liked?

Delectable.

Oh, especially when
egged on by his wife.

That poor thing.

Married to this puling mooncalf!

Whoa -- is that Drive-In Chick?

Wow, you're... beautiful.

Your arms, legs,
and head, they're so...

fabricated. Yeah?

This is a pretty cool
experience to have together.

- You guys are tight.
- Hah!

- You're tight too, Bruce.
- Tight musketeers.

You've got a little
wire. Mind if I...?

- - A monster!

Your expressionless
head came off!

- - How are you talking?

What is it?!

Ew, dude, look!
She's just a just-car!

And she's got passengers.

- Oh, it's so gnar.
- Oh, my God.

I can't believe I touched you.

So gross and fake.

Oh, the changeformity!

Jerry, have any other
dreams this week?

Yeah, I dreamt I
fucked your mother.

Yeah, good one, motherfucker,

but nobody raises
hell at my expense --

Oh, goddammit, easy, easy.

Jerry, what seems to
be the problem here, pal?

I'm not your "pal",
I'm your punchline.

I heard these assholes talking.

I know I'm some grand
joke for their amusement.

This was low, Rick,

but I guess my wife
can go even lower.

Jerry, I get how this
may have looked,

but we were just having
fun. At my expense!

Honey, no, I love you for
being lame in a different way.

Uh, w-why
don't you get it, Jerry?

You're the man of the house,
and you don't have a job.

[ SIGHS ]

Delivery for Rick.

Morning, Summer, Beth,
and Jerry.

- Gross. What is that thing?
- It's a courier flap.

It's like the intergalactic
version of UPS,

but less off-putting.

Oh, shiiit!

It looks like an egg-vite
from Birdperson.

Must be time
for his annual Oscar party.

And, by the way,
our TV signals take light years

to reach his planet.

Nobody tell him
that "Braveheart" wins.

[ MUSIC PLAYS ] Greetings.
This is Birdperson.

And Tammy!

Inviting you
to planet Squanch for

our mate-melding ceremony...
Blugh!

[ MUFFLED ]
If you're from Earth,

that means
we're getting married!

Oh, my god! My friend Tammy's
marrying Birdperson!

What the hell is a Birdperson?

He's Rick's best friend.

the gift
of gooble box technology,

which, when stomped on,
generates electricity,

powering our homes
and businesses,

improving our daily lives,
while safely removing

the dangerous waste power
to a special disposal volcano.

But why has Rick returned?

And what will he say
when he hears the big news?

Let's find out.

You need to tell these people
they're in a battery, Rick.

It's messed up.
There's caterers down there.

Th-Th-They're setting up
chafing dishes.

Would you relax, Morty?

There's nothing dishonest
about what we're doing.

Now slap on these antennae.
They need to think we're aliens.

- What? Why?
- Sh... Obviously [BURPS]...

You really [BURPS] know
nothing about car repair.

[ FANFARE PLAYS ]

Wait for the ramp, Morty.

They love the slow ramp.

Really gets their dicks hard
when they see this ramp

just slowly extending down.

[ CHEERING ]

Greetings!

[ CREATURES CHANTING,
"RICK! RICK!" ]

Morty, you gotta flip them off.

I told them it means
"peace among worlds."

How hilarious is that?

[ CREATURES CHEERING WILDLY ]

RICK: Coming through.

Two real aliens walking
through here.

Rick, our alien friend.

Uh, Mr. President,
um, couldn't help but notice

that you were having problems
generating power.

That's correct. [CHUCKLES]
We've evolved.

Our most brilliant scientist,
Zeep Xanflorp,

has developed a source of energy

that makes gooble boxes
obsolete.

[ STRAINING ]
I would love to see it.

That's strange.

Airflow is down 20%.

So, the brain isn't
getting enough oxygen.

That's why security's offline.

Well, I guess we
better check it out.

Hey! Wait for me!

Put that back on!

If we got up to the
Bronchial Catwalk,

we could look for a blockage.

I'll go.

[ LAUGHS NERVOUSLY ]

Don't be a hero, kid.

I'm not.

I'm doing it because it's fun.

We shouldn't be here.

Whatever you do, do not
fire that thing in here.

We must save Reuben.

This is my life's work.

[ BLOB SQUEALS ]

[ GASPS ]
It's all right, my dear.

Nearly all human lungs contain a
strain of these bacteria,

but the scar tissue
keeps them...

dormant.

Morty, get down!

Whoa-ho-ho!

Whoa!

[ BACTERIA SNARL ]

Whoa, whoa, whoa!

[ GRUNTING ]

Oh, what are those things?

Tuberculosis...

Not faster than a bullet!

Aah!

Don't let me die!

- No!

That's one of the most
violently aggressive

creatures in the universe!

- Ow!
- He's my son!

And if you hurt him, you'll
have to kill me, Rick!

[ GROWLS ]

Dad, I'm so confused!

I know, Morty Jr.
I'm sorry.

I ended up lying to you
and yelling at you

just like my parents
did to me.

You know, parents are just
kids having kids.

One minute, you like
how a shiny robot looks.

The next minute,
you're in a fist fight

with your alien son.

I'm an alien?

We all have bad
impulses, bad thoughts.

We just have to learn
to channel them

into something
constructive.

But I want to murder
everyone I see.

Well, you know, I mean,
maybe there's a job out there

for people that feel
that way.

MAN:
Actually, there is.

Hi. I'm Brad Anderson,
creator of

the nationally syndicated
comic strip "Marmaduke."

You should consider being
a creative.

I'm haunted by uncontrollable
thoughts

of mutilation
and sexual assault

on a near daily basis.

But, you know, I channel it
all into my work.

Does that mean you'll finally
have to wash your robe?

Good point, I need to reboot
the portal index immediately.

Basically just a hard reset
on the fluid.

Hold tight,
the Earth's gonna shake a bit.

Um...

Oh!
Ohh, shit.

Wait, what?
W-What's happening?

Instead of resetting
portal travel,

I may have reset
portal travelers.

Too late to apologize.

Rick,
why am I pulsing green?

And don't say you don't know
because you're pulsing green.

Rick,
are we about to die?

No, we're about to vanish
from this reality.

That's totally dying!
No, it isn't.

It's everyone from this reality
returning to

their reality of origin.

Back to our
original universes?

I explained it fine, Morty.
You're spoonfeeding spoons!

W-Where's Summer?
Oh, nice,
you guys are back.

Whoa.
Summer, three of us
are one-way blind hopping.

You gotta help us get back.
There's a protocol for this

in your chore server,
filename Booger AIDs.

Every file
is Booger AIDS!

I-I hate naming things!
Just search for words like

"one way blind hop
reset nav beacon."

Why do I have
a "reality of origin?"

There's no time to explain,
Jerry!

Counting on you, Summer!
One way blind hop

beacon protocol!

Here we gooooo!

So there was time
to explain.

Don't waste
extra precious seconds

with your pettiness,
Jerry!


Once we bring your Rick
back to life,

then I'll help you
with the bully.

Go ahead and open the hatch
to the subterranean lab.

That's where all
the cloning equipment is.

Please tell me you're not
hitting that crystal again.

Look, Rick might be the epitome
of bloated flesh privilege,

but he's right
about one thing.

You're gonna be a lot happier
if you focus on the moment,

rather than on
how you're gonna die.

I mean, w-who's worried
about that, huh?

Sorry, Hologram Rick.

I'm going with the crystal
on this one.

Morty.

Oh, alright, okay.

Just because I can't interact
with solid matter

means you can just
walk all over me?

Dear God.

Bist du faschistisch?

Nope.

Finally.

I thought maybe you were
pussying out.

Hyah!

What the fuck?

Oh, the air's getting thin!

Well, well, well, looks like
there's a new bully in town!

Lucky for us, he just made
bully-bullying the new bullying!

Bully him!

Aah!

We've got an Akira-type
situation going on

behind the mall.

- Yes, sir! Can do!
- Stand down!

- Not even a scratch.

get to pick the name.

Whoa!

Whoa. E-Easy there,
little guy. It's okay.

I-I-It's okay.

Do you... recognize me?

Do you know you came from me?

I'm Morty.

I'll call ya "Sticky,"

'c-'cause you're sticky
and -- and you're stuck.

Oh.

Step aside, Morty.

It's okay. Y-You
don't gotta do this.

It's haploid genetic
code, Morty,

a biological
fertilizing machine.

W-What's gotten into you?

Rick, let him go.

Ugh.

Morty, don't fuck with me.

What the hell's
going on with you?

I think I know exactly
what's going on here.

Kidding. This shit
is totally random.

- Let's keep moving.
- W-Which way?

When one sense is bound,
the others are released.

Holy shit. He -- He
can smell caves?

I'm not trying to
smell anything.

The whole planet's a
dorm room trash can.

Sir, Rick Sanchez has gone dark.

Eat lead, pussy!

No, no, no!

Fuck!

Oh!

Son of a...

Did he use a portal?
He wishes.

He wriggled back
to the meta layer

through a hole
in the fourth wall.

Put these on
and help me find it.

I-I don't like this, Rick.

Yeah, you shouldn't.
It's not a likable premise.

I mean it's funny
when I do a little nod
to the viewers, but...

What viewers?!
That's the right attitude,
Morty.

A few carefree verbal asides,
always by me.

None of this season-three
"Moonlighting" shit.

Okay, here it is.

You're going
to --to patch it?

No, he subverted
actual reality, Morty.

He needs to be
put down like a rabid dog.

Ow! Fuck!

Oh, yeah, no, you don't wanna
wear those over here.

Maybe he went
down that road?

No, no, no. If he took that,
he'd end up a hero.

Damn it, Rick.
I don't like this.

I-Is this whole place
just --

A bunch of
groan-inducing wordplay

for seven TV critics
that won't even enjoy it?

It's worse than you think,
Morty.

We're basting in
meta radiation right now.

Our credibility is
being permanently eroded.

Every second we spend here

is the equivalent
to 10 "Space Jam" cameos.

You should have thought
of that...previously!

Get him!

Ow! Ow!

Oh, no!

Bless me, Heavenly Father,
for you will save me.
Jerry, just leave the door.

It's not a door, Beth.
It's debris.

I don't care.
Just leave it.

Yeah. Okay.

- What?

Nancy told us
what a bitch you are.

Guys, seriously.
Nancy?

Summer, you're a bad person.

All you care about is having
popular people like you.

That's not what
Abradolph Lincoler stood for.

Well, i-it was hard to pin down
what he stood for,

but it's certainly not
what he died for.

Next time I party,
I'm just gonna focus

on getting totally wrecked.

You're so wise.

[ MUMBLES ]

May I assist you with that?

Uh, sure, yeah.
Thanks.

Morty, do you know what
"wubba lubba dub dub" means?

Uh, that's just Rick's
stupid nonsense catchphrase.

It's not nonsense at all.

In my people's tongue, it means,

"I am in great pain.
Please help me."

Well, I got news for you.
He's saying it ironically.

No, Morty.
Your grandfather is, indeed,

in very deep pain.

That is why he must numb
himself.

- Come on, um...
- Birdperson.
Pretty soon, Dad.
Yeah.

Are you...lying?

You kind of said it with
that tone in your voice

that we use for dying people.

I won't lie to you.
You're dying, Dad.

And we're...

not leaving the video game.

We're -- We're gonna
live our lives out here.

What?
Why the fuck?!

Why?
It's more real here.

The hell it is!
My liver hurts!

I'm old here!

I wanna be a teenage boy!

I want to jump around
and do homework

and jerk off
all over the place.

But, Dad, that's --

We would've been one

Okay,
this is a little awkward,

but the time dilation has
given me a chance to reflect.

And I-I-I gotta say --
There's no need for that.

I've come to tell you,
I'm giving the go-ahead.

All of Morty
will leave with you.
man in the universe.

Every version of us
has spent every version

of all of our lives
in one infinite crib

built around an
infinite fucking baby.

And I'm leaving it.

That's what makes me evil --

being sick of him.

If you've ever been sick of
him, you've been evil, too.

Rick, did you really
leave the crows for me?

Or did you come back
because they dumped you?

There you go, kid. Now
you're Evil Morty, too.

Sooner or later we all are,

on this side of the curve.

- Ah!
- Ah!

Don't worry, Morty.
We still got a way out

they never thought of
-- Operation Phoenix.

Doesn't that still
mean, like, death?

Sure, but the joke's on them,

'cause we just found a
backdoor to getting off this rock.

REROUTED. REROUTED.

Oh, my fucking God!

Come on, Morty. We gotta go.

You can come if you want.

Don't blame me if you don't.

Ugh! From where I sit, Morty,

that's the best
deal on the table.

I-I don't have a real plan.

Thanks, pal. I-I'm glad
you ignored my advice.

It's just as well. I lied.

That second seat's a toilet.

Oh. Super dick move.

But weirdly kind
of cool to admit it.

Geez, you guys really
are bred for forgiveness.

Let's go.

Say goodbye to
the Citadel, fellas.




Ooowee! Evil Morty.

That was quite a scheme.

Makes me wonder if
there's an evil me out there.

But I guess sometimes
I look at my life,

What? No.

I-I-I didn't even want
your sandwich.

I don't want your sword.

Oh, believe me, son.

You want it.
I don't understand.

You're knights?
With a "K"?

Of the Sun with a "U"
or -- or an "O"?

Your alphabet
is of no concern here.

We are sworn defenders
of Helios,

the center
of this system.

Okay,
so it's "Sun" with a "U."

Oh, God.
Morty, don't take the sword.

Oh, I'm shocked you're
against something, Rick.

You know these guys?

I know how they're dressed
and how boring this sounds.

You take that sword,
you're gonna get sucked

into a whole complicated --

Oh, shit!

Come on, take it.

Uh...
I mean, if that kid's
not gonna take the sword...

He didn't offer it
to you.

Sorry. Can I just ask
some stuff?

W-What does
a Knight of the Sun do?

He takes the sword,
for one thing.

You know what?
Maybe you made a bad call.

He -- He doesn't want
the sword.

I didn't say that.

Well, you sure
aren't taking it.

Would you just take
a random --

Obviously I would, yes!
And I did!

Best decision
of my life!

And you're shitting on it!

Excuse me?
Is this just a free sword?

No!
I'm taking the sword.

- Wow, really?
- That's pretty cool.

And, yes, yes, yes, yes,
you save the world now and then.

America returns that favor

by not holding the two of you
accountable to its laws.

- Oh!
- Oh! on, God.

We -- We didn't know
you saw it that way.

Well, it's nobody's fault.

We never had "the talk,"
so to speak.

RICK: Yeah. I mean,
the way we see it,

when we show up,
that's the favor to you.

Especially, you know,
when it turns out

you wanted someone to come over
just because you found

an "X-Files" monster
in your basement.

As for the reason you've never,
like, arrested us,

we assumed you just knew
that it was impossible,

like, if you tried.

You know, it wouldn't go well.

Wouldn't go well?
Can you elaborate?

I think one of your 1,000 laws
says, no, I can't elaborate.

Just trust me.
None of us want to go there.

Which we'll never have to.

By the way, we'll keep on
saving the Earth.

You know, we're --
we're happy to do that.

RICK: Yeah, but not because
it contains America --

because moving to a new version
of Earth is a bitch and a half.

But feel free to call us, you
know, as -- as, like, friends.

Yeah, like, if you ever
want to take a selfie --

So, are we cool?

- Bye,Dad.

Rick, didn't you say
you needed my help

on an adventure immediately
somewhere else --

I don't care --
even if it might kill us?

I did not, but if you're
really that alienated,

I'm as willing to exploit it
as the next guy, church, army,

or Olympic gymnastics trainer.

We're not telling you
what to do.

We're just sharing
how we feel.

And now weather --
is anyone else cold,

or is it just me?

I am Mar-sha,
ruler of Gazorpazorp.

I am here
if you need to talk.

- What is this place?
- Paradise.

We built it during the great
passive-aggression,

when the females separated
from the males

due to their increasingly
destructive behavior.

I am here
if you need to talk.

I am here if you need
to talk.

From here, we dispense
mechanical surrogates

to maintain our population.

Fertilized surrogates are
returned here to our nursery.

The females are placed
into educational programs

where they can discover
a service to our paradise

that fulfills them most.

Males...
- [ BABY GIGGLING ]

...they get to play outside.

That was just a baby.

And within a day, he'll be
an adult male Gazorpian --

one of the most aggressively
violent creatures

in the universe.

Wait a minute -- we're here
because a male Gazorpian

was born on our planet.

You speak when you're
spoken to, ding-a-ling!

It's true, though -- one of your
babies was born on Earth.

Are you the ruler of this
Earth?

- How did you know?
- The quality of your top.

- Do you love it?
- I love it.

I'm here if you need to talk.

I'm here if you
need to talk.

I'm here if you need
to talk.

If the Gazorpian is male,
your Earth is in grave danger.

Anyway, so, yeah, the suspect
says the Citadel's a lie,

built on lies,
and some other shit.

I say appreciate
the life you have,

because it can always be worse.

- Tell me about it.

an unexpected turn of events
as Morty from the Morty Party

soars to the top of the polls.

- Morty! Morty! Morty!
- Yes.

Morty, what's your original
reality, and where's your Rick?

Gosh, we moved around so much,
it's hard to remember.

I see every Rick as my Rick.

<i>I hope they see me
as their Morty.</i>

Another? Please?
With less water?

Hey, cheer up, pal.

A Morty's gonna be president.

Imagine this kisser
getting blamed for everything.

I guess I should've
had more faith.

It's not faith you need.
It's fear.

What's this?

It's secrets.

<i>Of fear. Itself.</i>

<i>But, no, I'm not afraid.</i>

when there's a Morty president,

Mr. Sanchez!

The President is very
eager to speak with you!

Morty, look, you gotta
do me a solid here.

Y-you want me to keep the secret
of where these things came from?

Yes, technically, it's
a lie, but I messed up,

and I'm embarrassed
'cause it's, you know, science.

No problem. I got
your back, dawg.

Really? Okay. Cool.
And thanks, Morty.

I thought that'd
be a harder sell.

Y-You did a shameful thing.

Dwelling on it isn't gonna
help, you know, am I right?

Sometimes you
just gotta wipe it off,

toss it in the trash, and
head back to study hall.

Uh, not getting the metaphor
but I'll take your hall pass.

Sanchez! Get the hell in here!

Space Sperm?

Jesus, how big -are space dicks?
- Same page club.

Well, Mr. President, the
theory of Cosmic DNA

has been around for
decades -- Chupacabras, Yeti,

Stonehenge, Ancient Rome.

Are these all myths,
monsters, legends,

or different names for
sperm from outer space?

I'll tell you what
I think, Sanchez.

I think either you
caused this mess,

or it's those godforsaken Horse
People that dwell underground.

--CHUDs. -CHUDs.
-That's them.

Ugh, if they're behind
this, so help me, God.

Morty, you've always
been a straight shooter.

You can't prove
that! Wait, what?

- Oh -- oh. Right.
- I can protect you, little man.

Blow that whistle. Toot, toot.

Is this your grandpa's fault?

Here's what I know, sir.

This is the greatest
country on Earth.

Time to get Jerry.
Ugh.

Maybe I wouldn't be
so uptight

If I wasn't married to

it's been a decade.

Woof.

-Oh, no, you got expelled.

-Whoa, what a horrible thing.
-You are so fucking dumb!

-Too bad, Morty.
-Hi, hon.

but I think I'm glad we spent
that time divorced.

It's colder than Beth

Also, look who I found
in Rick's room.

Mmmm, I'm Mr. Frundles!

I don't care
how cute he is.

We agreed

No, exactly.
And the slave planet thing,

I hear he broke their chains
with pure urine, so...

Hey, guys, sorry I'm late,

Take a seat, Jerry.

We were just discussing
Pissmaster's honorable rise.

I mean, who cares, right?

Uh, people are talking
about him.

He's becoming likable.

Good, even.

But...
he's Pissmaster.

People change,
Jerry.

Everyone loves
a comeback story.

All in favor of

offering orbship
to Eugene Michael Piss,

aka Pissmaster?

Orb-yes.

All those opposed?

Obviously orb-no.

The orbship has spoken.

You know what, Jerry? I think
this is a good test for you.

If you can't let go of your
pettiness enough

to recruit Pissmaster, maybe you
don't deserve your orb.

And, Jerry...

don't come back without him.

Absolute chaos!

No one knows who planted
the bomb,

but one thing is clear:

Orphan Island, a city
populated entirely by orphans,

now sits on the brink of doom.

The Orphan Island bomb squad
is trying to dismantle

it as we speak.

I can't stress enough,
I'm eight years old,

I have no idea
what I'm doing!

It's Pissmaster!

Oh, no! There's no time
to dismantle it!

could have repeated sex

with a horse machine without
it becoming Armageddon.

It's dimension 35C,
and it's got the perfect

climate conditions for a
special type of tree, Morty,

called a Mega tree,

and there's fruit
in those trees,

and there's seeds
in those fruits.

I'm talking about Mega seeds.

They're... [BURPING] they're
incredibly powerful,

and I need them to help me
with my research, Morty.

Oh, man, Rick. I'm looking
around this place,

and I'm starting to work up some
anxiety about this whole thing.

All right. All right.
Calm down.

Listen to me, Morty.

can be intimidating.

all scary and different, but,

on, charging right into them

but I was already

taking a big leap of faith,

I'll get every single part of me

to get on every ship
and go with you.
Good.

But you have to tell us
you love us.
I had nothing but time.

Endless time.

At first, it was madness.

Then enlightenment.

Then madness again.

But perhaps it was a gift.

I could see the life of time.

And as I watched
the life of time

in all its fleeting,
terrible light,

I wondered, had I lived?

Was I just the object
in another's story?

Was that all I ever
was? Could I be more?

I had nothing but time
and still no answer.

Time without
purpose is a prison.

I have glimpsed into
the mind of eternity.

Perhaps the mind of God.

And found nothing but silence.

I think we should
just be friends.

Oh, yeah.

I-I-I get that.

Guess we missed our moment.

Yes. But there will be more.

I did it again, Katie.
I ran out on another job.

Well, if you didn't do that,
you wouldn't be my man.

I was almost tempted
to just let it go.

I hate it here.

Who's this guy, now?

I am Mr. Twist.

The fifth member of
the Self-Referential Six.

Who's the sixth?

That's the twist, Morty.
It's you.

What?
Ignore him, Morty.

The twist is
there's no sixth member

and he tells that
to everybody.

In any case,
you're ours now.

You can't free yourself without
a twist, and I control them.

You don't control every twist,

I just won a bunch of shmeckels.

Why don't we use 25 of them to
pay slippery stair here for a

then we'll give the rest of the

You would?

This is all so overwhelming.

But, uh...

- Absolutely not.

I'm sorry?

We've been waiting 16 years

for our daughter to respect us,

but the key is,
it has to be our daughter,

not this person she's become.

We'll take our chances
raising her

without fancy new jobs,

outside of
a potato-based religion.

And you know what? I-I'm sick of
pretending that we're together

because of the kids
in the first place.

I married you because
you're the love of my life.

And I'm lucky to have you,
and I never tell you that!

of this stronger as a family.

Please don't do this!

- Summer, listen carefully.


Shit!

RICK: Well, the longer you wait,
Morty,

the more it's gonna feel like
committing a whole murder.

I think your arm
just called it too early

because it wasn't
the arm of a paramedic.

Here.

It's the least I can do.
I-I-I-I owe you this much.

See, Morty?
Now we're both accountable.

[DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING]

The reason I wanted this
is because it can do this.

This is a really special thing.

I mean, you could use it
to power all your vehicles.

You wouldn't be

Rick, I'm not an idiot.
I know what this is.

Oh. Okay, well, I told Morty,

"Look, parents get divorced.
They get sad. He'll be fine,"

but I think he's worried
you're gonna, you know...Pbht!

And you know how Morty gets
when he gets emotional.

It impedes my work.

So, I told him I'd take you out
and give you a win.

Wait. My son asked you
to take me

On some kind of pity adventure
to keep me from killing myself?

Wait, w-what
did you think it was?

An execution.

Geez!
You really do need a win.

No!
I-l don't know.

I mean, you never made me
the pants, so --

So, you thought
I was gonna drive you

into the middle of the galaxy
and shove you

into the vacuum of space
with your dick hanging out?

And we're seeing how you'd act
if that were about to happen?

I mean, shit, I'll make you
the pants right now.

Take me two seconds
to make you pants.

- I have pants at home!
- Jerry, if I make pants,

they'll be better than
your pants at home.

Also, if I wanted to kill you --

Yeah, I get it.
It'd be amazing.

Please, take me home.

I'll tell my son we had
an amazing adventure.

Well, if it's all the same,

could we go
get our story straight?

Because you're a terrible liar.

You called me
a master convincer!

You believed me?

Huh. This seems...kind of fancy.

Jerry, for all you know,
this is the equivalent

of an alien truck stop.

You have no frame of reference.

You're in a universe
beyond your imagining.

But, yes, it is super fancy.
Because if they are,

how are they gratifying
to the male at all?

And if the goal is
to make something up,

why not make up
something...funnier?

I'm asking too many questions,
aren't I?

How ironic.

Get out of Florida,
you overthinking cat.

Why don't you go overthink shit
up north in Georgia?

Hate that cat.

You got any money
for a cab?

Why ask questions?

Why not just have fun?

I deserve that.

Attention, citizens of Draygon,

a slut dragon has escaped.

is also a slut.

you can feel my pain.

you suck your dick,

which is also
somehow my dick?

Aw, why can't couples that start
out cheating ever end up happy?

M-Maybe I can find
that wizard's portal spell

in here and g-get us home.

How about finding the spell
that unbinds me

from your fucking dragon?

No spells can do that.

Only the wizard
can unbind soul bonds.

Uh, who the fuck are you?

Who are we?
Who the fuck are you, bitch?

Debrah, stop.
We are the slut dragons.

We live in these slut caves
where we fuck,

suck, and eat butt, and
we kindly ask that you leave.

he will imprison us.

'cause we can fuck
woolly mammoths. Get out!

Get the fuck out of here,

Like I didn't see
that coming.

Fuck me.

Great work, Morty!
I'm adapting!

Here's our ticket
out of here.

They got him in a cell
made out of sports

because it's
the opposite of story.

Do I want to ask
who he is?

His name is Brett Caan.

He has the power to make things
always have been other things.

I think
that's called retconning.

B-But his name's
Brett Caan?

I mean, Rhett's a name too.
His name could be Rhett Caan.

It is.
And always has been...now.

Whoa.
Careful, Morty.

Stay clear
of his retcon range.

Until he agrees
to help us.

Rick,
you've always trusted me.

Nice try.
Here's how it's gonna work.

You're gonna make it so Morty
and I never came here.

Once that's always been
the case,

I'll free you remotely
with this.

What is my purpose?

To wait until I tell you
to pull that lever.

You are
fucking kidding me.

If you don't free me
right now, Rick,

I can make
very, very bad things

always have been
the case for you.

Is that a threat,
you fuck?

Y-Y-You can rot in there.
Rick.

You know what, Rhett?
Forget what I said.

We've always been friends.

Good one.

This is camping.

Camping?
Ooh!

Camping!

Good work there, TickTock.

Keep whittling.
Incredible.

You've almost got smoke
over there, Florflock.

There you go, guys!

Pump those cheeks.

That's the camping spirit.

What the -- Squeeb!

This is not a tent.

It is a new
kind of tent,

with special gutters
to funnel the rain, and a door.

It's a house! No houses!

No doors! Once you have doors,
you have indoors.

Once you have indoors,
you won't want to camp anymore.

Then why do they not camp?

Because they're bad.

Bad. Bad. Bad.

Oh, my God.
Maybe Dad was right.

Maybe we have
no life skills.

I've definitely drank more pee
than I care to remember.

I'm just gonna sit down.

If I die, don't eat my ass.
That'd be weird.

Uh, Summer?

Damn, you think
they got infected

by a mind slug
or something?

Probably drove through a nebula
that made them

see their own fears.

and go take care of business.

we go on adventures with.

You're one of those
creeps who moves in

with abandoned adult Beths?

It's more complicated than that.

You live with a version
of our dead daughter.

- I-It had better be.
- Get off your high horse, Lone Ranger.

I'm you. Youwill go on to be me.

Yeah why do you
think I'm horrified?

I'd be fine walking
by this on the street.

I might even give it a dollar.

"This" is where you
being "this" leads.

You met me on my
way to save a very old,

very real friend after
a lifetime of reality.

I met you on your
way to a fairy tale

- at Blood Ridge.
- Wait, you're saying Blood Ridge goes bad.

We have a Vietnam?
That's fucking cool!

Why am I saving a
friend that remembers me

as this insufferable?

BP, where the
hell are you going?

Probably there.

Damn.

Wow, he's really taken
some drastic self inventory.

What do you think is down there?

If I had to guess, I'd say
we're near the memories

the Federation suppressed

when they resurrected
him as a cyborg.

- He might be here to unseal them.
- He was a Federation cyborg?

That means there might be
some juicy intel down there.

Shit, they blew a hole in
the human resources department!

- I'm putting this in your file!
- Downsizing already? - You're fired!

We gotta fix this, Dad.

We can't keep
recycling them through.

I could add an online
college workaround.

Or just push them out
through a pipe in the back.

Same thing.
Same thing.

These kids may not be mine,
but you definitely are.

Look at you.
My little steampunk overlord.

Eeee!

I don't think
he's coming back.

You know, you -- you really
messed him up, Summer.

Yeah, well,
he called me a lemur.

Let's just go
find grandpa.

Maybe he can portal us home
or something.

Should we leave a note?Dad is fine.

He's probably
sucking off a tree

and having the time
of his life right now.

Guess you don't want to learn
how to skip rocks, either.

Aah!

Aaah!

Whoa! Whoa!

Aah! Aaaaaah!

Ohh!

Aaaaaah!

Gah!

Ohhhh!

Aaah!

Aah!

Aah!

Aaah!

Ow! Hey!

Aah!

Aaaaah!

Aaaaaaaah!

Ohh!

Who are you guys?

We are...
unproductives.

Ahh, I get it.

Bunch of bullshit.

What is that?

This?

in the last 20 years
has eaten this thing's poop.

Fortune cookies
are alien poop.

These fortunes
are so basic.

Why wouldn't you use this power
to change the world?

Or at least get Nintendo
to make a portable VR headset?

Ooh, this place ain't
for creatin' the future,

but controllin' it.

Hi, I'm Old.
Old M. Hucksbee.

The "M" stands
for "Man."

You're an arch
little character.

You're the reason
fortune cookies suck?

No, no, no,
that's Jenneth Chunt's idea.

You have to glut the marketplace
with pointless fortunes

to increase the value
of real ones.

Controlling destiny
for a price --

that's the Fortune 500's
fortune.

And you're trying
to stop them?

Just tryin' to get out.

I want to be free
with this here alien gal

so we can get married.

Then we can have relations.

Can't do that before marriage,
you know.

I'm a Catholic.

Uh, does the alien
want that?

It's not exactly what I'd call
a sentient species.

A man knows.

What does this
have to do with me?

You put this in my cookie.

Yep. Oh, I've been tryin'
to get people's attention.

I'd make fortunes saying,
"You're a-gonna break your leg

unless you investigate
this cookie company,"

or, "Please come help me

or a virus will
shut down the world."

Finally I just made
a bunch that said,

"You're gonna have sex
with your own momma."

How many? It --
What happened to the others?
or "Drive very fast
between two of them."

We don't serve your kind here.

Oh, my God, are you serious?

Read the sign.

He's my boss, Marvin.

It's okay.

Mistrusting Presidents
is a patriotic duty.

And that guy on TV isn't me.

He's a turkey
infused with my DNA.

I'll be damned.

Well, I'm racist.

You better not be here
to take my man again.

- Mary Lou.
- I'm poor!

And pregnant!

With a poor person!

And I need you.

And 10% of your baby.

Now, look, I know it's gonna
take more than some speech.

But what is a speech?

Isn't it just a question?

And isn't that a question too?

Speeches are words.

Repeated words.

Listed words.

Repeated lists of
repeated words.

None of that matters.

You know what does matter?

Me. Asking you.

"Will you do what I say?"

Just two questions, Chief.

Lock? And load?

They're rhetorical, sir!

Lock and load!

Sir, we've got Rick and Morty
coming in what appears to be

an unlicensed "Star Wars" AT-AT.

Or as the millennials
say, A-T, A-T.

So it begins.

Gobblers!

Tonight, we rise!

Aww, geez, geez, geez.

Nice driving, Sanchez.

[WHISTLING]

What the...

[GRUNTING]

Ah! My hands are dry!
My hands are dry!

My name is Risotto Groupon.

I am the assistant general
manager of the restaurant.

Do you have any comment cards?

Because I might have
some thoughts.

My kingdom was usurped by force
with weapons and technology

supplied by
<i>your</i> father-in-law!

Hey, he usurped
my kingdom, too, man.

He basically got me kicked out
of my home, stole my family.

Then we are brothers,
and you have wondered

what your life could have been
without Rick.

Wondered? Sure.

I mean, I've wondered
about having a vagina.

Would you help me kill him?

What? No!

He's my wife's father.
Move on.

Do you...like theme-park rides?

Oh, you really moved on.

There is a popular attraction
here called the Whirly Dirly.

Between the first whirly
and the third dirly,

the ride dips just outside
the immortality field.

You're asking me to lure Rick
to his death?

I'm only asking you
to go on a ride with Rick,

get off the ride without Rick,
and go home to your family,

where you can...
wonder about having a vagina.

Okay, okay, that was
a very specific example

pulled from thin air.

I don't want to be known
as the vagina guy.

Risotto, you're needed.
Someone ordered

the Nuzzy Guzzy Fresh
and Fluzzy Special.

[SIGHS DEJECTEDLY]
Look, I'm not like Rick,

so you're free to do
as you please.

But there comes a time
in every man's life

when he must choose
Feast? No time.

S-S-Sounds pretty
classic though,

don't let me hold you up!

Son of a bitch. He marked it.

Ah!

Phew.

Hah.

What the --

Hey, what the hell?

Agh! Jesus!

You got some of that
green stuff on you too, huh?

Th-Th-This is bad.
Th-This is really bad.

Hey, how do you think I feel?

I had the ultimate stash hole
and now I got a kid in my thigh.

Look, you seem like a perfectly
nice guy in my hand hole,

but if I can't sort
this out I'm dead --

What the hell, dude? Gross.

I-I-I was just trying to...
You're just trying to what?

Where'd this stuff come from?

Garbage Goober, get out
here and eat this garbage.

Mmm, trash, I love
trash, yum yum trash,

I wanna eat trash --Hell
yeah, I love that lil guy.

Wait a minute.

Is that Mountain Dew in my
quantum transport solution?

I-I saw you were
marking the levels

so I-I had to top
it off. "Top it off?"

Do you know how
dangerously toxic this stuff is?

And you added it
to my portal fluid?!

Only because you don't trust me!

Oh, that's great logic, Morty --

forgive me for not doing
the kissy chef gesture

since you probably
spilled this shit everywhere

and I don't want
to teleport my lips.

I did I did not spill it!

I won't take your word for
that and I shouldn't have to,

which is why I
have sidekick rules.

If you can't follow them --

I can be replaced, yeah,
yeah, so you keep telling me.

Excuse me? Did you
just try to call my bluff?

Oh, boy. W-What's wrong, Rick?

Is it the quantum carburetor
or something?

"Quantum carburetor"?
Jesus, Morty.

You can't just add
a s[BURPS]... sci-fi word

to a car word
and hope it means something.

Looks like something's wrong
with the microverse battery.

We're gonna have to go inside.

Um, go inside what?

The battery, Morty.
Be right back, Summer.

Stay put,
don't touch any buttons,

and ignore all random thoughts
that feel... spidery.

Wait! You can't leave me here!

You'll be fine.

Oh, man. Where are we, Rick?

Morty, remember eight
seconds ago when... you said,

"go inside what?"
And I said, "the battery"?

Can you alter the course
of being a giant fucking nerd?

Sorry.

Also, later, we need to discuss
your clothing and your weight.

That's fair.

What the hell?

Target acquired.

Snakes!
Get back in the car!

Morty, enough with the --
Snakes!

Target acquired.

Aliens, I am a robot sent back
in time by the Snake Resistance

to protect you
from Serpacorp.

My appearance is designed to be
familiar and to put you at ease.

The ape child must be eliminated
to protect our timeline.

Morty,
what the hell did you do?

I was just trying to do
the right thing.

I took a living snake --

Get behind me.
I will protect --

Aaah!

Why -- Why are they
attacking us?

I-I-I helped them.

You gave them proof that
there was something bigger

and scarier to unite against,
you little idiot.

They would have gone back
into the Dark Ages

for a couple of generations,

but instead,
they dedicated themselves

into making
universe-destroying,

un-thought-out technology
like time travel

all so they could try to kill
a little shit sack on Earth

who couldn't let
a dead snake be dead

even after
it bit his ankle.

Next time,
stay in the fucking car.

17 billion snake lives
ended on June 21, 2026.

The survivors lived only to
face a new nightmare,

the war between
snake and machine.

In the end,
snake overcame machine

because of what
we couldn't predict --

just end whatever this is --

I understand you're
upset, Mr. President.

It's honestly all Morty's fault.

But in the meantime, you
really want to keep your army

of pointlessly camouflaged
Eagle Scouts off my lawn.

Don't tell me what I
want, you anti-American

piece of shit, you terrorist!

You know, you use
that word so much

it's lost all meaning, Mr. P.

It's like, at this point,
what's a terrorist?

It's a guy you
don't like. Big deal.

Hoo-rah!

Told you to stand down.

You just lost two soldiers
over here. Good men.

Might be time to look at
the terrorist in the mirror.

You want a war?!

I'll put your outer-space ass
in a goddamn Phantom Zone

with a bar of kryptonite
soap around your neck.

You're done,
Sanchez! You hear me?

Oof. He's really
pissed this time.

Why don't you guys just
fuck and get it over with.

Okay, well thank you, Summer,

but I think I've
got a better option.

Dad, no. Ehh...

hands are tied, sweetie.

I have to turn myself into a
turkey and trick the President

into giving me a
Presidential turkey pardon.

Again? How many
times have you done this?

I don't know, Jerry, how
many years have I lived here?

Careful how you answer that.

Geez, Rick, y'know,
y-you've done this a lot.

Don't you think the President
might see it coming this time?

He probably will, Morty.
That's all part of the dance.

In the past, I've
inserted myself

into the potential turkey
pardonee population

by brainwashing the
presidential turkey wrangler

prior to the ceremony.

But this time, the turkey
I-I'm innocent!
I didn't release those bees!

I love Jerry!

What'd I just say?
When?

Okay, great execution.
Let's go back to the chamber.

Now repeat after me, Morty --
"Next time on 'Rick and Morty.'"

Next time
on "Rick and Morty"?

No. Previously,
on "Rick and Morty"...

Ignore it, Morty.
"Next time on 'Rick and Morty.'"

It counteracts his toxins.

Next time on "Rick and Morty."
Whose toxins?

Hey, stop it!

Previous Leon!
Grab him!

Hold on tight, Morty!

We got to get through
the opening titles!

Opening titles of what?

-Whoa! We're in space!
-Let go of me! Ow!

Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!

What planet is this?

Cover your eyes
on this part.

Oh, my god,
it's a giant squirrel!

Why are we dressed
like old-timey people?

What the hell's going on?

Why is my dad in a suit?

-Best episode!
-Why am I butter?

Okay,
we're almost through.

Ohh!
Ohh!

Ow!

Ugh,
and we're back!

Stop!

Why was there music?

Because of this conceptual
little piece of shit!

If we have opening titles,
d-does that mean that we're a --

Let your body purge

Don't succumb to his pointless
self-aware bullshit.

It's not pointless,
it's cool!

you seem different.

Like you finally
found yourself.

Yeah.
I -- I guess I have.

That's good to hear.
I like who you found.

Yeah.
Yeah, I do, too.

Looking forward
to seeing more.

I'll see you tomorrow,
Morty.

Yeah.
Yeah, I'll see you tomorrow.

How's it going?

Y'know, it was fun, Rick.
Real fun.

Y'know I-I-I definitely
sowed those oats.

But I think you invented

a little lesson for me
along the way.

Living without
consequences is great,

but then I started
wondering...

what am I living for?

What am I building?

If I'm always looking back,
I'm never looking ahead.

And then it hit me.

We are who we are
because of consequences.

You can't live
without consequences, y'know?

You feel me?

Wow.

That's a beautiful thought,
Morty, but, uh, no.

There were definitely
consequences.

What're-What-What are you
talking about?

I mean.
You did everything you did.

It all happened.

No.
But the -- the respawn button.

The -- The do-over.It's not a do-over.

You just did it.
Over and over.

What are you saying?
W-What did you do?

I think it's more appropriate
to ask what did youdo?

You see, Morty, you weren't
saving your place

and going back.

I don't respect
time travel.

If "Ant Man and the Wasp"
can do it, I'm not interested.

- No.
- That's what I thought, bitch.

No offense.

and live out

of your vagina fantasies.

that everyone has!

What are you doing?

I'm being triumphantly brave!

It's not triumphant or brave.

You're not risking anything.

You might shoot me.

- What do you mean, no?
- Whoo!

I wouldn't be a

I'm sorry, Morty.
You're way too young.

But y-y-y-you were a teenager

I was 17!

That's at least 26 in boy years.

I'm sure Planetina is very
nice, but when you're a teenager,

Pluto's not a planet.

They changed it in 2006.

Yeah, I heard about that, Morty.

And I disagree.
- You disagree?

That's right. It's possible
to disagree in science, Morty.

Pluto was a planet.

I disagree back.

help me make sense of

this morning?

It's written by someone
claiming to be me.

They say my mind is held captive
in a time loop,

trapped in the day of
a traumatic event

by the agony of
a formidable intelligence.

But also that my captor
forgot about aging --

that my body spoils and yearns
for death

while my soul remains
stuck in place,

caught like a fly in amber.

Right.
I used to drink drink.

Uh, no clue, pal.
That's okay.

I found other notes in the trash
just like it.

Poor weirdo.
I pity them.

Wish they could let go
and move on.

Sounds healthy.
Sure would be!

Ohhhhhh!

Sweet death.

Was that symbolic?

Are you letting go?

I understand, baby.
I forgive you --

You don't get to say that!
You're not her.

You're a thing I built to
torture myself.


I mean, my job here is
to make Morty happy.

I'm not gonna take you
somewhere dangerous.

-[ GRUNTS]
- Rick Sanchez.

I told you if I ever saw
your face in here again,

I would stick you
like the pig you are.

[COUGHS] Shnoopy Bloopers,
I told you if you tried...

there'd be two funerals.

Aaah!

Someone?

Uh, someone?
Someone!

[ 50TH GRUNT]

[BOTH LAUGHING]

My friend!
It has been too long.

RICK: Oh, it's great
to see you again, buddy!

-[ BOTH LAUGHING]
- Yeah, you're doing it.

Mr. Sanchez gets
anything he wants!

The resort's covered
in an immortality field.

You can't die here.
That's the gimmick.

[LAUGHING]

Okay, but still --
bad parenting.

Hey, rich a-holes
are rich a-holes.

They all pay top dollar
to come here

and enjoy a consequence-free
vacation.

No death, no disease,
no dismemberment.

-[ GRUNTING ]
- Can't even have a heart attack.

Got it.
The perfect place

to take the most fragile being
in the universe.

I can tell you expect me
to refute that,

but it's right on the money.

If I come home without you,

I doubt Morty's gonna
let me off the hook.

Yeah, but what if you came home
with Jeff Goldblum?

Jeff Goldblum? What the fuck
are you talking about, Jerry?

[SPITS] Jesus!

Holy fucking shit!

Yo, what's up, "Big Chill"?!

Don't go into that telepod!

Whoo!

Yeah!

Yo.

D-Did I get paid yet?
Whoo!

I can't believe we're getting
Gear Cream with a Vindicator.

So, you girls in Gear college
or Gear --

-[ EXPLOSION]
- Alien terror attack!

Okay. Sounds like
a job for...me.

I better go
get into my alter ego.

-[ GASPS ] So cool.
- I know.

Wait, what alter ego?

He was already wearing
the jacket.

[ BREATHING HEAVILY,
WHIMPERING ]

Gotta know when to hold 'em
and --

Aaaaah!

[CLUNK! ]

﻿Hey, you kids!
Don't be bad outside my store!

I keep a nice store!

Give it up, old man!

We're just cool bad kids
doing young stuff! Chh!

You guys wanna do
more skateboard moves?

Which ones?
The rad ones,
that's which!

How are you kids?

Did you know your grandpa's
tryin' to get your attention?

Yeah, yeah,
screw off, weirdo.

Grandson,
w-w-what's that mean?

He's one of
those cult people.

They worship some psycho
named Roy

that says
he's everybody's grandpa.

So what do you want to do today,
e-eat some snacks

and maybe let me
kiss you finally?

Y'know,
with my mouth and stuff?

This is going on
right now.

L-Let's go check it out.
Aw, geez.

C-Come on, just for fun,
you know?

No, that's not what I'm --

You guys keep thinking
There's joyful
and there's joyless,

and we've had our fill
of one.

Morty, make that sweaty writer
stop working

while I kill off
his character.

I have never been more driven
to destroy someone.

Yeah, well, I'm driven
to lower my blood sugar

but guess who's getting tacos
after he kicks your ass?

So you're jacked.
Who cares?

Cum gutters.

I don't like that phrase.
I don't take notes.

You can't beat me, Rick.

I have one million times
your motivation!

So do those guys with the
cellphone kiosks at the mall.

The hair is wrong.

Like you'd be picky
about licensing.

Actually, I would.
I happen to believe that --

You can do that?

You got to want it.

Come on, just stop.
I-I don't want to fight you.

Kid, I'm a writer that wrote
something successful.

So if you want me
to give it up,

you're gonna need a black belt
or a big pair of tits.

Yeah, well,
I don't have those.

In the mythical sense,
I have both.

Joseph Campbell?

Yeah, nice try.
He died in the '80s.

Only you can see and hear me,
Morty.

Just repeat
what I tell you.

Okay.

Sir, you're only proud of
your creation's success

because you want
to be creative,

but creation doesn't happen
through gimmicks,

technology, and distribution.

It doesn't even happen
through work.

Creativity is frankly adjacent
to mental illness and overlaps

with it substantially.

A lot of talented people
Are you -- Ugh!

Nobody gets it.

Nothing you think matters
matters.

This isn't special.

This -- This is happening
infinite times

across infinite realities.

Including this?
[ FARTS]

Yes!

Which is not to say that,
subjectively, it wasn't funny.

Are you going to stay?

There's infinite
timelines, Morty.

Why would I stay in the one
where I trashed the White House,

became an enemy of America

and the lowest-status character
in my idiot family?

Because of the fart?

There's still some rubble
over there.

I don't think you've
ever understood

what "Secretary of the interior"
means!

Hi, Mr. President.
I'm Rick Sanchez,

but not the one that did this.

We Ricks travel the infinite and
switch places with each other

like hermit crabs, I think.

I'm Fly Fishing Rick.

You can distinguish me
from the Rick

that you had a falling-out with

by my fly-fishing enthusiasm
and accompanying hat.

I hope I can be of service

if, uh, you ever find
the planet to be in danger.

Ff lends?

Sounds good to me.

Kids, dinner!

I got Panda Express!

Did you get sugar chicken?

That's kind of the only
thing they have.

I love Panda E!
Thanks, Mom!

I'm hoping to get a piece
of your sugar chicken later.

[LAUGHS] Stop it.

Here's your [BURPS]
stupid hat, dipshit.

Dad, you can't talk to Jerry
that way anymore.

We're a real family now.

We will give you passage
back home

so it can be terminated.

But first, mojitos.

We don't have time
for mojitos.

- You are insulting them.
- I don't care, Summer!

This place is the worst!
I want to go home!

Well, it really
doesn't matter what you want,

because this is a sane place
where women rule.

Yeah. You know what
I have to say about that?

[ FARTING ]

[ ALL GASP ]

WOMAN:
I cannot believe my ears!

[ FARTING CONTINUES ]

Whoo, boy!
Who let the frogs out, huh?

Grandpa!

- Grandpa?
- That sounds patriarchal!

Lt means "father of father."

Then this one
is not your slave,

and your Earth is yet
another planet dominated by men.

It's not dominated
by us, okay?

On Earth, men and women
are equals.

Equals?! We make 70% of your
salary for the same job!

- Seize them!
- Whoa!

[ CHOKING ]

Was this really the time
to make that point, Summer?

This is for you, Daddy.

Oh, man!

Um, okay.
Listen to me, Morty Jr.

I've got to tell you something
very important, okay?

Killing is bad --
bad!

[ GIGGLES ]
You're silly, Daddy.

No, Morty Jr.
I'm being serious, okay?

You need to put your energy
into something else.

I mean, what about dancing?

Would you like to learn
how to dance?

I'd like to dance --
on the graves of my enemies.

Ohh!
No, Morty Jr.!

I hate you so much
right now.

This will be
the first instance

of capital punishment
in our society

in 500 years due
to our awesomeness,

so we are forced
to improvise.

We placed a large boulder
on that ledge.

Holy shit! Y-Y-You're gonna
crush us with a boulder?!

No! Stop interrupting!

The boulder falls
onto a lever

that will launch...
knives.

What?

Just give me a gun.
I'll kill myself.

Stop interrupting!

The knives will --

Fine! You were right
the first time, okay?

The boulder crushes you.

I just didn't want to admit
you were right. Happy?

No, just ignore them.
Ignore them.

Such an asshole.

RICK:
Look, I'm sorry, Summer.

I feel bad that I let you
drag us into this.

I wish I could have been
a better Grandpa to you,

and, you know,
for what it's worth,

that is a really nice, cute top
that you're wearing there.

Top. My top!

My top -- the same top you
complimented earlier!

Look -- look at the tag.
Read it.

Lt says, "Marc Jacobs."

Marc? Jacob?
These are names of the penis.

Yes.
An Earth man made this top.

Maybe on your planet,

separation of the genders is
the right thing to do,

but on Earth, a certain
percentage of our males

are born gay,

which is why my clothes are
better than all of yours.

[ GASPS ]
A man made something fashionable?

It's true, and sometimes
the truth hurts,
about a shark...

he's got lifeless eyes...

black eyes, like a doll's eyes.

When he comes at ya,

he doesn't seem to be living
until he bites ya,

and then the... the blood,
and the red, and the water...

[ SIGHS ]

You ever wonder what happened
to Rick and Morty?

Sometimes.
But, I'm ashamed to admit,

now that they're gone,
I'm finally happy.

Here we are, Cronenberg Morty...

a reality where
everyone in the world

got genetically Cronenberged.

We'll fit right in,
Cronenberg Morty.

It'll be like we never even
left Cronenberg world.

Yeah, Cronenberg Rick,

but, you know, I'm gonna miss
Cronenberg world,

because everyone
was Cronenberged all along

like us from the beginning,
you know?

I mean, l-I wish we hadn't
genetically ruined

Cronenberg World
beyond repair like we did,

you know, and turned everyone
into regular, normal people

just walking around.

Don't you worry about
that sort of thing,

Cronenberg Morty.

Let's go make ourselves
at home, huh?

Did you get any of that?

It's a good-a show!

Rick, we did it!
We -- We got it!

Hurry up, Morty.
Get in!

Chachi!Fuck Chachi, Morty.

Did you get it?He helped me escape prison.

Did you get
the Ultimate Cube?

Oh, it's purple.

Y-You said
it was purple.

I said mine was.

I didn't know they all were.

And now we do,
thanks to Chichi.

Chachi.

So, uh,
Ah, okay, then without
further ado -- drop him.

Oh, yeah!
Oh, yeah!

Oh, yeah!
Oh, yeah, oh, yeah!

Looks like I'll be
eating ass flambé.

Please kill me.

﻿

It's the crow man!

Give it a second.

Maybe he's taking
it out to surrender.

He's anti-heroic. Run!

I don't understand.

He's only one man!

With the power of
a thousand crows.

Oh, oh! Ooh!

Good luck.

Crows and owls have
always been at war,

but why do you care?

What's the point?

Here's two.

Ha-ha! Yeah. Cool. Morty?

Uh, h-hey, man!

Good to see you!

Y-You're, like, looking, like,

into crows... still.

Oh, uh, two crows,
you remember Morty.

Morty, two crows.

It's good to see you,

but if you'd given me
more of a heads up --

Well, I-I was just
in the neighborhood.

I-It wasn't like --It's just
that the battle for crows

is kind of never-ending.

Huh. Right.

A little pointless, then, right?

That came out wrong,
s-sounded judgy.

- Crowhorse. Crowhorse.
- Okay.

- Crowhorse. Crowhorse.
- Looks like...

looks like they're
leading you to a thing.

Take care, Morty.

You -- You too!

I-I'm doing good, by the way.

Oh, my dad was gonna eat
that yogurt you left in the fridge

but I-I told him --

Way cool.

But as above, so below.
Know what I'm sayin', Rick?

Morty, you must be referring
to these excellent boxer shorts

we got from the good folks
at Boxer Lobster.

Boxer Lobster Boxers feel like
they're warm butter

on your schwantz.

And they come in all sorts
of styles --

neon, plaid, orange.

I-I even got a pair
with that little, uh --

the raccoon man from that
one movie, uh, printed on it.

Chewbacca.
Do yourself a favor

and level up
with Boxer Lobster Boxers.

You'll be glad you did.

Oh, shit,

Rick, they want you to say
"Wub-a-lubba-dub-dub"

at the end.
Screw that.
We're not whores.

Guys, dinner's getting cold.

You know
what's not getting cold?

This hot stack
of ab-jacks, son.

Pow! Pow! Pow!
Pow! Pow! P-Pow!

Pow! Pow! Pow! Pow!
Pow! Pow!

Pow! Pow! Pow! Pow!
P-Pow!

No notes.
Oh! One more thing.

Night Jerry said Night Summer
would appreciate it

if everybody could rinse off
their plates after eating.

What?

You know, rinse the schmutz off
after eating.

Makes it easier
to clean up later.

What?

Our job is not to make the
night people's chores easier.

It's a reasonable request, Rick.
Takes two seconds.

They exist only to do
the shit we don't want to do.

So until further notice,
which will be never...

...request denied.

Hello there.

What the cock?
Where are the dishes?

Uh, Dad?
- Yeah, I did.

Now keep those collars on so you

don't break
your weak-ass time again.

How long, exactly, do we have
to wear these things?

They're really embarrassing.

Well, since you're going
to time prison,

I'd say you can
keep them on forever.

- Time prison?
- Yeah.

Well, I don't know where you
expect me to think

you got that crystal over there,

but the only way your dumbass
assin' ass asses

could ever have one
is if it was stolen.

You stole a time-freezing
crystal from testicle monsters?!

I would've been happy to pay
for it, s... [BURPS] Summer,

but they don't exactly
sell them at Costco.

Besides, there's a larger lesson
to be learned here. Get him!

No, no, no, no!
You better keep back!

Man, this will turn your ass

into a third-trimester fetus
from 30 yards.

[ MONITOR BEEPING ]

Mm.

Isn't there a kitten somewhere
that needs a manicure?

That's right, Mrs. Smith.
Give in to your anger.

Neglect that deer.

Honey, it's gonna be okay.

These men are
from the Cervine Institute

of of elk, moose, deer,
and stag.

They can take this deer
to a helicopter

and fly it to the country's
top deer surgeon

on a wildlife reserve
across the state border.

Where your jurisdiction ends.

I guess that's the end of that.

There is just one more thing.

According to this state's
Veterinarian statute,

this animal can't be transferred

until the current
attending physician

verbally confirms
their inability

to provide adequate care.

- LOGIC: It's Logic, y'all.
-Invited a bunch of people.

Hmm. Well, that's gonna shoot
through me.

Morty, you're wearing
a Vindicator jacket.

Are you a little superhero now?

Everyone in the universe

Which is why
we don't need jackets.

And I'm pretty sure
we don't need Vindicators.

Don't mind if I do.

just sets up

And all that stuff I said about
Vance, that's not real.

Vance, fuck that guy.
That guy sucks dick.

I mean,
if that's what you want.

Oooo weee! Big storm coming.

Could be a twister.Mm-hmm!

Hey, Rick?

Can you walk me
through something?

Yeah.
What are you thinking?

So, you and Morty
knew you needed my help,

but you weren't sure
I was good enough at karate,

so you hired my grad students
to attack me?

Yep.

But it was an emergency,
Rick.

How long did that take?

It actually took less training
than you'd think.

Your students all shared

a pretty keen aptitude
for martial arts.

I don't know
if that's by coincidence

or if there's some correlation
with their passion

for African-American
Women's Studies.

Maya Angelou did personify both
acquiescence and perseverance.

Ooo wee. That's exactly
the kind of connection

I'd have loved
to explore in my class.

Too bad I lost my job

for putting my students
in the hospital.

Yeah. Yeah.

Sorry about that.

Mm-hmm.

Did you get any of that?

﻿MORTY: I gotta tell you, Rick.
It's pretty great...

to be in this spaceship,
just the two of us, you know?

Just cruising around,
Rick and Morty style.

I agree, Morty. [ BELCHES ]

It's nice to get
back to the basics

after a pretty intense,
mixed-bag of a year.

- Ohh!
- Relax.

That's what windshields are for.

I didn't know that
there were bugs out in space.

Well, w-what did you think,
Morty?

﻿Why are we waiting in line
for food?

It's a pop-up.

It's a rare, pop-up
restaurant thing

that only enters
our solar system -- Rick.

You're gonna
spoil your appetite.

That's a weird way to say
I'm gonna stop being hungry

by eating food,
but whatever.

Three crispy,
uh, four wiggling.

You're probably not even hungry.
You just don't like lines

because they aren't
about you.

Another weirdly aggressive way
to describe a friend

respecting themselves.
-Eugh!

What a wonderful thing
to say!

Ha ha! I was merely inspired by
the wonderful thing you said!

Sirs? Guys?

You dropped this.

Please,
take it as a reward.

So courteous!

How nice it will be for you
to eat

what you were willing to stand
in line for so much sooner.

Oh, no, that's okay.

I came to stand in line
and then eat.

I-I wouldn't wanna do it
differently.

this moment

to surrender my sword
so that you may succeed me

as the newest

- Yeah.

Hi, folks. Head Priest Vagina.

Thanks for farming
all those potatoes.

It's 6:00 p.m,
so if you're a parent,

you're now entitled to
adoration from your children.

I'm going to start dinner!

I don't know what to say.

Summer
is doing really well here.

She's aced every test
in potato class,

and look how important
potatoes have become.

She's not getting pregnant or
doing drugs or missing curfew.

Please help me.
You can reach me if you try.

Please help me!

That's not our business
as long as Summer is thriving.

Taco time!

I hope it pleases you
as the Head desires.

That's wonderful, Summer.

We're so proud of you.

But obviously you don't have to
make dinner every night.

Of course I do, silly! [ GASPS ]

Oh, my god, daddy!
I'm sorry I called you silly!

I'm so sorry!

Heavenly Heads
and cranial creator,

forgive my transgressions
against family and community.

May my chores complete me
as I complete them.
We didn't need their help.

We were not the problem.

They sort it at
the trash facility.

My dance videos

are getting,

Oh, yeah. The dinos
kicked pedophiles off TikTok.

Great.
So now I'm broke?

You don't need money
anymore.

So what's this for
now?

Phone calls? Ugh.

Oh, c'mon, Dad.
You don't hate this, too?

Why would I? I-I was
already doing what I wanted.

I do think
it's kind of funny

that you're all basically
Jerry now.

Fuck.

Jerry,
how do you do it?

-Yeah, Dad, how do you do it?
-How do you do it, Dad?

- Huh?
- How do you do it?

It's finally happened.

All right.

Does anyone know how to
mail things to publishers?

Uhp.
President only pages me

if it's an emergency
or he needs Molly.

I'm sure glad
you stayed open, Beau.

Wish we could pay,

but no more capitalism.

I never make ribs
for the money, Mr. President.

Oh, um, here ya go.

That's not why I called.

Drugs can't solve
this problem.

I can't live
like this anymore.

At first it was fun
spending all day

watching whatever
YouTube autoplays

after the last
one autoplayed,

but a man can only watch

What's the problem? Children.

Okay, gettin' right into it.

- I am! I am!
- Jesus Christ!

- I am!
- I am!

- Dad, do something! Make it stop!
- You think I know how to stop this?

Cool vacation, guys.

So happy I got to see

instead of micro-dosing
with my friends.

Yeah, um, Baby Quakes,
how big is your orbit again?

I mean, not to say
you get around, but, um...

Are you kidding me?
Look at them!

They look just like you.

Yeah, and snakes
look like dildos, Beth.

What's your point?They do?

The fact is even if they
were mine,

which they're not,
the best parent is evolution.

They'll probably develop harder
skin or maybe even webbed arms.

Man, that'd be cool, huh?
Flying squirrel people?

Yeah, Dad, that approach
worked out great for me.

Beth, I know it looks bad,
but trust me.

This is life
in the galaxy, okay?

It's totally normal.

Fine.
You won't do something, I will.

Welp, there
goes the surprise!

I was gonna have us jump
on the trampoline

after we caught
our first fish.I am!

What?
You're stupid.I am!

- I am! I am!
- Beth, that's not gonna help.

Uh, I hate to
agree with Rick,

but shouldn't
we just let this be?

We're supposed to be
on vacation.


[SCREAMING]

Rick, up here! There's
a spot where you can kill him!

Good call, Jerry!

- Hey, how'd you know about that?
- Uh...

[ BOTH SCREAMING ]

[BOTH LAUGHING]

Lisa?

[ BOTH SCREAMING ]

So, uh, Jerry, big fan
of the Whirly Dirly, are you?

Not anymore. [CHUCKLES]
Obviously.

But when you were,
how did you know about it?

[GRUNTING]

We had a deal, Jerry Smith.

It's a really common name.

Now, take it easy, Rick.

You've been in a serious
roller-coaster crash.

It's -- It's no time
to be thinking about

who did or didn't play a role
in your attempted murder.

[SCREAMS] Get it off me!
It's eating me!

Look, I confess, okay?

They told me about all the
bad stuff you did to this planet

and reminded me of all
the bad stuff you did to me.

But then you said
you were sorry, and I realized

you're not a monster --
not like this thing.

Fuck!
It's got me good.

This is a mislead, right?

You're inventing a thing
to save me.

That would be called
a knife, Jerry.

It's been invented.

I'm making a way out of here.
One seat ought to do it.

I'm sorry.
I-l made a mistake.

- I won't do it again!
- Nobody ever does.

[GRUNTING]

You self-righteous
piece of shit!

You took my family!

I took <i>your</i> family?

Who do you think
had more taken from them

when you shot 20cc of liquid
dream-killer into my daughter?

She was <i>Rick's</i> daughter, Jerry.
"President" Morty,

that we don't care
who sits in that seat.

A Rick, a Morty, a goddamn
Jerry, doesn't matter.

We've been running the Citadel
since before the council,

and you'll find that we're
still running it now.

Does he really speak
for everyone here?

- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah.

Well, I think it's important
to be clear.

Raise your hand
if he speaks for you.

Is...that enough off the top?

I don't know. Is it?

- Yes, yes, goddamn, yes.
- I think it's great.

Good.

This seems like
a good time for a drink

and a cold calculated speech
with sinister overtones.

A speech about politics...

About order...

brotherhood...

But speeches
are for campaigning.

Now is the time for action.

and I can see her again.

By the way, hey, um,
still not curious about

what might've happened
at that crazy Citadel place?

Psh. Not at all, Morty.
That place will never have

any bearing over our lives
ever again.
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

[ SCREECHES, GURGLES ]

Oh, man. I cannot wait...

I cannot wait to hear Rick
explain his way around this.

He is gone.

Jerry, stop, please, okay?

We weren't even
supposed to be down here.

If we confront him about this...

Oh, my god! I love this.

I love that this is
how far you will go for him.

You want to go upstairs
and cut carrots

and watch a Lifetime original

above a fucking alien dungeon!

Your relationship with
your father is psychotic.

Oh, listen to you
relish the idea

that my genius father
is a bad person.

Step out of your ego
for a second

and look at this thing...
It's a monster.

He might have it chained up

so that it doesn't
eat the planet!

Right, because your father's
such an altruist?

I once saw him briefly
forget the word for "Humans."

He's probably harvesting
this creature's organs.

He's probably racing
to cure its space AIDS.

- He's going to eat it!
- He's protecting it!

[ SHRILLS ]

BOTH: Shut up!

[ HUMMING] Whoa!

Unity, this place is a mess.

Oh, it's cool.

Oh, I'll never make it.

Ah, I'll push it to next week.

He's unavailable. He's...

having sex with you.
We get it. Gross.

Get him out here now.


I love soaring through the sky
with you as equals.

W-What do you
want to do?

I want to enter my lair
and sleep upon my hoard

until the Age of Man
expires.

Okay.

Split the diff?

20-minute nap
and soar through the sky?

Ugh.

As you command.

Okay, see you soon.

T-This is fun.

Yeah, right.

What's this show called,
"Ass"?

Yeah, it's like "Bones,"
but they solve ass crimes.

This ass is a clue.

Are these two
gonna hook up?

No, and only the lame fans
want that.

Don't tell me
how to enjoy things.

Go to her ass.That's Brenner.

Go to Brenner Ass.

Honeymoon over
already?

What's that
supposed to mean?

Admit it, Morty.
Dragons suck.

Why don't you admit you don't
anyone else to be happy

because
you're a sad old fart?

How do you
saddle a fart?

Holy shit.
Look!

- I love you, Ass.
- I love you, Brenner.

No.
Shh.

Ah!
Oh!

And that's the end of the

First off,
I always slay it, queen.

Secondly, yes.Should I pause "Ass"?

Nah, it's kind of boring
now that they're together.

Hey, fuckface.

Will you shut the fuck up
or at least roll over?

really low-tech.

Yeah, 'cause
we're measuring reality.

I would
take out my penis

and place it in the box
on the...right.

Again.

I would put my penis --

Jerry, you don't have to say
"penis" every time.

Just left or right.
Hey, this was your idea!

I didn't think
it'd go on this long.

Okay, penis. Ugh!
Left!

Keep going.

Right.

Left. Right.

Jerry, are you
fucking peeking?

Tell me what's going on!
You're scaring me!

Okay, I'm just as likely
to shit a balloon

as I am to become
a dolphin.

Those are things
that could happen?

Jerry, everything is
as likely as anything else.

Which is why it's weird that
you're at all likely to...

To what?
To what?!

Jerry, has your mother
been leaving messages?

Three texts.
I'm afraid to read them.

Read them.

She's asking
if she can come visit.

Why would she want that?!

Jerry, I'm gonna
tell you something

I've never told anyone.

We need to go
to Panda Express.

If these guys
wanted my respect,

they could've just gotten
a liquor license.

Now you think this has
something to do with you?

Jerry, whoever's behind that
fortune has, like, god powers.

Of course it has
something to do with me.

What do you think I am in this
story, the father-in-law?

You guys
wanted my attention?

Okay, well, now

and add one double-cross
with a switcheroo.

Compiling crew members

God damn it, Morty,
what did I tell you?

Rick,
I-I want to say goodbye.

Don't turn around.
I'll explain later.

Looks like you're available
for a job.

Your skills
are required for a job.

You son of a bitch.
I'm in.

Man, this is really
coming together.

You know, Rick, I've been
busy working on writing --

A heist script.

Yeah, you almost
never bring it up.

Oh, shit, we --
we should head over.

Hey, guys.
What do you got?

Pretty!

Morty,
put this in your backpack.

Grandpa's gonna run
to the bathroom.

Ugh.
Wasn't even a heist.

All you did was --

Write an algorithm

based on two heist movies
I slept through

and used it to automate
a joyless process you call art?

Yeah, I really did, didn't I?

So I'm in your crew now?

Yeah, well,
you're in good company.

Right, everybody?

Yes.

My God.

Your skills are required

No, they aren't.

coming up through
the sewer lines

talking about hope and change?

- Fair enough.
- Good clapback, Rick.

What's the deal
with that, Mister P?

I got a little project going on.

Required some hands-on labor.

It would require less
if you were willing

to tell me how one might

bring down the
Central Finite Curve.

Alright, time to go, Morty.

I want to know what
he's talking about.

Yeah, you've come all this way.

Can you give me 10 more seconds?

Literally 10? Because
now it would be 6.

Oh, I'm fine with that.

Make it 2.

One.

Like I said, would have been
a big help for you to tell me,

but I should have everything
I need from you now.

Let me just make sure.

Oh, most of yours got
scanned a long time ago.

- Evil Rick.
- We kicked his ass!

can just grab it like a joystick.

Looks complete.

I was afraid I'd have
to kill every Rick

on the Citadel to
get what I needed.

He only came here
because I asked him to.

of Eternal Life.

Is this --
are you fucking with me?

Oh, trust me, Morty.

I've done plenty of
effed up stuff in my life.

But it's never too late
to accept Christ.

Jesus is always
knocking at the door.

All we have to do
is open it and let Him

into our hearts.
How?

I'm so glad you asked,
Morty.

Just close your eyes
and go to Him in prayer.

Like this.

Heavenly Father.Heavenly Father.

Thank you for sending
your only begotten son.

What a second, no!
What are you doing?!

Jesus, I accept you
into my heart.

No! This sucks.

Stop! You guys would
never do this.

Fill me with your Spirit.

Make me a shining city
on a hill for you.

- No! No!
- Make me born again.

- No!
- In Jesus' name, we pray.

- Amen.
- Amen.

- Amen!
- You did it!

Way to go, Morty!Crossy.

Bible-Saurus.
You made it.

We wouldn't miss this
for anything!

You said it,
Mr. Celery.

What the fuck
is all of this?!

Greatest story
ever told, Story Lord.

No, it's not.
It's awful!

I beg your pardon?

Ah!

Goddamn.

My Lord and my God!

- No! No! It sucks in here.
- Let's get the fuck

outta here. Go, now.

Ugh.
We're safe, Morty.

and I thought,

"Well, this is it. She's going
to see that I'm a loser,

and I'll never get
to touch her.

But I still have time
to touch her."

But my hand had Snickers
on it,

and the brass section
was swelling

because it was the scene with
the guy melting in the lava.

And I just thought, "Fuck it.
Lips don't sweat."

Wow. Yeah.

I'll never forget that feeling.

You're the real thing.

Then that settles it,

because my memory
is of hating that night.

But now, reliving it,
all I can feel is how lucky I am

to be loved by such a simple,
honest, simple man.

Simple twice.

This isn't the woman
you married, Jerry,

because this woman loves you.

It's not gonna

Oh, geez, Rick, that's not good.

I-I have to be back
at school right now.

How are we gonna get back home?

There's ways to
get back home, Morty.

It's just... it's just gonna
be a little bit of a hassle.

We're gonna have to go through
Interdimensional Customs,

so you're gonna have
to do me a real solid.

Uh-oh.

When we get to Customs,

I'm gonna need you to take
these seeds into the bathroom,

and I'm gonna need you
to put them way up

inside your butthole, Morty.

In my butt?

Put them way up inside there,
as far as they can fit.

Oh, geez, Rick.

I really don't want
to have to do that.

Well, somebody's got
to do it, Morty.

Th-these seeds aren't gonna get
through Customs unless they're

in someone's rectum, Morty.

[ WHIMPERS ]

And they'll fall
right out of mine.

too many times, Morty.

- You used to be my little girl.
- [ CHUCKLES ] Yeah.

Remember when we used to
go to the playground,

and I'd push you on the swings?

Oh, you could push me higher
than all the other kids.

You were so small and cute.

I thought you were gonna fly
right off into the street.

[ CHUCKLING ]
I used to pee my pants.

I know, and now look at you!

You have a job.
You're making really good money.

You're not paying any rent,

so you have plenty
of disposable income.

Oh, god, Dad. Please, don't.

I just need
a few hundred dollars

I can feel it.

I'm going inside.

Ow!

It's okay, Morty.
It's the purge, you know?

Pushing old lighthouse keepers
down the stairs is totally cool.

It's not cool, Rick.
I-I'm not like these people.

I can't run around chopping
people's heads off

one day a year and then
sleep well the rest of the time.

Well, you better start getting
used to it, little bitch,

because we got

You can do this.

How did this happen?!

Where's the
Abductions Department?

Hey, man, Abductions just
follows the acquisition order.

Don't put this on Acquisitions!

We only acquire humans that
haven't been simulated!

Well, simulations doesn't
simulate anybody that's been

abducted,
so [CHUCKLES] oh, I see!

Oh, oh!
It was no one's fault.

Oh, okay. [ CHUCKLES ]

I'm sorry.
Well, then, problem solved.

Oh, wait... no.

There's still another
human in here!

Who is he?

Rick's son-in-law,
Jerry Smith.

So far, he hasn't noticed
he's in a simulation.

[ SIGHS ]

Well, cap his sector at 5%

keep his settings on auto, and
we'll deal with him later.

we can speak freely.

this [BURPS] world is real?

You'd have to be an idiot not to

Well, a helpful rule might be if
you need something, you get it.

- Pretty simple, right?
- I need food.

- Who's got food for that guy?
- I do, but this is for me.

Can't you make some more?

Oh, sure. And while
I'm making food for everyone,

who takes care of my kids?

I'll take care of your kids,
if I get some extra food for it.

Extra food?

Well, I'm not gonna do extra
work if we all get the same.

All right, okay, fair is fair.

If you do extra work,
you get extra food.

- Oh.
- [ ALL MURMURING ]

Who's gonna keep track

of who gets how much food
for how much work?

Hello. I can do that.

I'll keep track
of everyone's food,

you know, in exchange for food.

That's not a real job!

Oh, and making food is?

You son of a bitch!

Eat this!

[ ALL SCREAMING ]

Guys, guys, guys, guys,
whoa, whoa.

Cool it, now. Take it easy.

There's too much
aggression here.

What if we designate
a period of time

during which we can all
get this hate, murder,

and rage out of our system...

I can't help but feel ashamed

about what I did
back there, Rick.

I guess you were right. I've got
a lot of repressed stuff

I need to deal with.
Don't worry about it, Morty.

Remember
those candy bars earlier...

that we got in the first act?
Yeah, what about them?

Turns out they have a chemical
in them called purgenol

that amplifies
all your violent tendencies.

Oh, boy. Whew!
Thank goodness for that, huh?

That's a relief.

Yep. Don't even sweat.
PRESIDENT: Yes.
Thank you, gentlemen.

I told you, man!

I'm impressed, Morty.
That went really well.

for a sad, drunk shell of a man

what would she think --

Don't fucking establish canonical

Oh, good. You're awake.

it never bothered me.

But this here is another matter.

You recognize this?

We got a tip
it was in your locker.

Yeah, now, because
the gym coach was a vampire,

the school board is embarrassed

and won't take it public,
However,

they can't have students
killin' teachers.

I gotta expel you
for this one, TR.

I'm sorry.

I just got expelled, Summer!

Oh! So I guess there's
no need to stay young.

- My top!
- Screw your top!

You ratted on me?!
I'm Tiny Rick!

Fine! Yes! Because I love you...

and I'm trying
to save your life!

High school is my life!

Summer Smith is
a fucking psycho nerd

and she just got me
kicked out of school!

ALL: [ GASP ]

[ CRYING ]

[ SOBBING ] Oh, my God.

Wait. You know what?! No!

The milk people don't
have a patent on

simple rhetorical questions!

There's not even a single word
in "Hungry For Apples" that's

shared by "Got Milk?"

It's a completely
different slogan.

It's different!

And I shouldn't be fired.

I should be promoted!

- [ SNAPS FINGERS ] Yes.
- Yeah!

Wait. Really?

- [ SNAPS FINGERS ] Yes.
- Yes!

I mean, I'm...
it may be derivative,

but it's the most successful
campaign to come out of this

agency in a long time.

[ SNAPS FINGERS ] Yes.

I-I'm not saying it should win
an award for commercials,

but it could certainly be
nominated for an award

for commercials specifically
about apples,

like... an Appley or something.

[ SNAPS FINGERS ] Yes.

Is there really an
award called the Appley

for Apple-Related ad campaigns?

[ SNAPS FINGERS ] Yes.

- Could we nominate me?
- [ SNAPS FINGERS ] Yes.

Holy crap!

[ BEEPING ]

Get in, Morty.

I'm gonna [BURPS] be able to use
these processors to make some

real important science stuff.

[ KEYPAD BEEPING ]

Huh.

I thought l entered
the code right.

[ KEYPAD BEEPING ]

Wha... well, what's this?

W-what could this possibly be?

Because it looks like
you're inside a simulation...

inside a simulation.

You're still on the ship.

Game-day bucket go boom.

of options to choose from.

They're all in this catalogue.

I don't care about prosthetics.
This is insane.

What do you people
think you're doing?

I understand your feelings,
Mrs. Smith.

Oh, I don't think you do.

I bring my husband in
for emergency treatment.

He's gone an hour.

And now you want his penis,
and you hand me some... catalog.

It's... It's...
It's... It's... I mean...

Sheesh. Well, there you go.
Sorry.

I know it's hard to understand,

but on Earth, love comes first.

There are those that believe,
Mr. Smith,

that Shrimply Pibbles represents
love between all life.

His fate will determine

the fate of hundreds of billions
of sentient life-forms.

Whoa! Whoa.
So, billions of life-forms?

Hundreds of billions.

I mean, Jerry,
y-you didn't explain

the full gravity
of the situation.

Uh, well, Beth,
I don't think your decision

should be based on politics.

Who could argue
with a wife's decision

to keep her lover intact?

Well, I don't think that's
fair at all, Jerry. At all.

In fact, the whole paradigm
has sexist overtones.

Beth, can we talk
about this privately?

You know, I think
the bottom line is, Jerry,

if you want to keep your penis,
you should say, out loud,

"I prefer to keep my penis."

But, Beth, what kind of man
would say something like that

if the universe needed
his penis?!

Well, Jerry,
what kind of wife would I be

if I did anything
to stand in your way?

Hey, listen,
is your mouth tiny and small?

Then why don't you come
to Lil' Bits...

get in the shower right now.

Y-y-y-you got to
trust me, Morty.

Ugh!

I'm gonna get an
"F" in class, Rick.

Morty, that's not class.

T-T-T-That wasn't your teacher.

This isn't your school.

This entire world
is not the world.

We're inside a huge simulation
chamber on an alien spaceship.

Wait a minute.

W-what are you talking about?

It's all fake [BURPS] Morty...
all of it.

Nanobotic renderings, a bunch
of crazy fake nonsense, Morty.

I couldn't say so until
we got in the shower.

They won't monitor us in here.

Monitor us?! W-who?!

Zigerion scammers, Morty...

the Galaxy's most ambitious,
least successful con artists.

You know, it's lucky for
us they're also really

uncomfortable with nudity.

Aw, come on, Rick.

If everyone's just
gonna be insane today,

at least let me be
insane with Jessica.

I can't [BURPS] let
you do that, Morty.

Give it to me!

No! [ BURPS ]

You give it to me!

G-g-give it! No, Rick!

[ ALIENS GROANING ]

Oh, God, Sir!
They're still naked!

Ugh.

Well, check every five Quintons
and tell me when they're not.

I think we should
make Kevin look, sir.

What?! No!

W-w-why would you even say that?

Uh, sir, we have
a situation over here.

If there's a wiener on that
monitor,

I swear to god, Stu...

something is drawing a
lot of processing power.

Oh, wait. No wonder.

There's another real
human in the simulator.
Aah!

You stole the gem I needed
to split tachyons

and probably fenced it

so the 80 people that did all
the work could each buy a beer.

You're not an artist,
you're Postmates.

I doubt this rivalry
can be settled with words.

Why don't we make things
interesting?

I challenge you to a heist of
the crystal skull of Horowitz.

In a heist off!

That doesn't
make things interesting.

It makes them "Ocean's Twelve,"
by far the worst one.

Every breath I take
without your permission

raises my self-esteem!

State your terms.

First crew
to heist the skull wins.

The other endures
heist culture's greatest shame.

They must join
the winning crew.

Lame. I accept.

Please welcome
Knightley's Eight!

Snake Arms! Double Microwave!
Monitor Lord! Key Catcher!

The Shape Shiftress!
Angie Flint! Glar! And Truckula.

Hey!
Half of Knightley's Eight

are just three
of Sanchez's Five!

Well, no heist is complete
without a double cross,

and I had the perfect job.

Heisting the crystal skull.

That was it.
Bye.

Looks like you're available
for a job.

With Rick Sanchez on my team,
I'll be unstoppable.

Rick,
welcome to Knightley's Nine.

Ugh, ugh!

Ugh! Rick, for real?

Eh.
You got that skull, buddy?

What? How?

With a little help
from some old friends.

Heistotron,
state your prime directive?

To heist.

Calculate Miles Knightley's
with a bunch of sex-doll
parts,

and I have to do it
one-handed

to keep these Belushis
from carting you off.

The least you could do is be
ashamed of your gender.

Ugh. What's the deal
with this place?

Why is it such
a sausage planet,

and how did such backward
idiots invent robots?

Obviously, at some point,

the Gazorpians became
so evolved

that they replaced females
with birthing machines.

The resultant lack of
distraction and hen-pecking

allowed them to focus entirely
on war,

so they bombed themselves back
to the stone age,

and now they just fight with
each other over fake pussy

with sticks and rocks
all day long.

You think it's efficient
to get rid of women?

You ever see a line for
the men's room?

Are you hear-- do you Li--
do you hear me, Summer?

[ RUMBLING ]
Droppin' loads.

ALL:
Droppin' loads! Droppin' loads.

[BETWEEN BURPS]
The plot thickens.

[ ALL SHOUTING INDISTINCTLY ]

Uh, you might want to cover
your eyes, Summer.

Yeah, like it was
my dream to watch.

[ ALL MURMURING ]

Yeah, baby!

Summer, grab --
grab hold.

Yeah, baby!

Aaaah!

Grandpa Rick, where
are we going?

Well, obviously, Summer,

it appears the lower
tier of this society

is being manipulated through sex
and advanced technology

by a hidden ruling class.
Sound familiar?

[ GASPS ]
Ticketmaster.

Oh, there -- there we
go, Summer.
Oh, my god.

That's some pretty
hard-core stuff,

you know, for a cereal
commercial.

Well, Morty... I mean, you
wanna sell boxes of cereal,

you gotta pump the gas a little.

Pedal to the metal, Morty.

In a world where muscular
Mannies are coming,

and they're coming strong,

there's only three
unmuscular Michaels.

Get down. Hurry. Run.

[ SCREECHING]

And that's when real
Turbulent Juice is coming,

and you got to take care of it.

With Turbulent Juice,
turbulent tables,

no room is safe
from the turbulent power

of Turbulent Juice.

- What in the hell?
- Sex sells, Morty.

Sex sells what?

Was that a movie or, like,
does it clean stuff?

- [ SIGHS ]
- Hey, Dad.

- God.
- What's going on?

Well, your mother and I
are gonna be spending

some time apart, Morty.

And your sister found out
she was an unwanted pregnancy.

- What?
- Speaking of [BURPS] what,

Morty, [BURPS]
what should we watch next?

What about this?

Babylegs, you're a good
detective.

But not good enough,
because of your baby legs.

So I'm partnering you up
with Regularlegs.

Hey, there.

Detective, I'm...
this is upsetting to me

because I feel like I don't
need no regular-leg partner.

Babylegs, don't talk back to me.

Good luck, you two.

There's a criminal to kill.
[ SLURPS]

Wow, you sure found
this guy quick.

Uh, yeah, because I'm a good
detective.

Hey, sorry my grandpa stole
your god and ruined your car.

We don't apologize,
and we have no god.

But this cracked driveshaft
brings me great pain.

There is no deeper bond

than the one between
a Death Stalker and his car.

What about the weird guys
on leashes, then?

They're more like...interns.

Cool, cool.

[HELMET CLANGS]

Sorry.

It's okay.

Can l...see?

No one has seen my true face
and lived.

Well, I'm not afraid to die,

and I don't care
what you look like.

[ GASPS ]

Oh.

Hmm?

I just...

I didn't expect you
to have a mustache.

- You hate it.
- No. I like it.

I guess --
How do I explain this?

A metal bucket is, on a certain
level, a kind of "mustache,"

in that it's a specific
facial accessory.

So, it's kind of like --

Do you guys have the phrase
"hat on a hat"?

- I can shave it.
- No. I like it.

And obviously what I like
shouldn't matter.

It's you.

Yeah, yeah, I know,
a-and nothing does matter.

Obviously, I know that.
I'm not weak.

I'm just thinking, "Well,
why not get rid of this?"

You just kill everyone
that sees it, and it's --

and it's hot under here,
wh-which, by the way,

is why I shave the beard part.

So, right there, I'm making
a decision based on vanity,

which is what
I was trying to avoid

with the whole bucket
over the head

because who am I
I-I'm guessing
you're feeling pretty stupid.

Yes. Thank you.

Sir Helios gave his life
with that sword.

Mortaniel took it.

He cannot leave unless
he bests me in combat.

Hmm.
Okay, uh, one sec.

I'm guessing these guys
are, like, pseudo-immortalish

since they live on the Sun,
so playing by their rules

might be the fastest way
out of this.

J-Just best him
in combat.

What?
Here.

This sword uses A.I. to learn
from an opponent's attacks.

So I have
to get attacked first?

No, no, no, the sword
has already seen "Blade."

And loved it.
You'll be fine.

-By golly!
-Ooh! Crikey!

Okay, so we're done here.

No. We're not done.

I am done.

You are
now king of the Sun.

Protect the Scepter
always.

No, no, no, no,
I don't want to!

Well, how is
that supposed to work?

He's king, but he was never
even a knight.

I mean, that's stupid.
Uh, it's --

it's definitely a...
Sun first.

A king with a penis?

Well, what do you want
from me?!

All hail King Mortaniel!

Uhhhhh, as your king,

I hereby declare a vacation,
for me.

I'll come visit you guys,
on, like, Sun Day...

Sundays.

If I forget,
just wait a week.

Keep doing that,
keep the crown. Peace.

Hell yeah. See?

That's from when
he's fighting Deacon Frost.
of an evil monster!

- I can hear you.
- Yeah, so you keep saying.

[GRUNTS]

- Summer!
- Wake up!

You have to have some
individuality left in there!

Why do you hate me, Summer?

I'm not talking to you.

I'm talking to...
Steven Phillips.

Steven, set yourself free.

Summer, before I took
over this planet,

this man was
a registered sex offender.

Yeah? Well, so what?
At least he was himself.

This woman was a drug addict
on the verge of suicide.

Now she's a marine biologist.

Listen, Unity, I don't think
my sister's trying to say

that life would be perfect
without you.

I think she's just saying
that life would be,

you know, life.

I have transformed life
here into a paradise.

Prostitutes are now scientists.

The homeless
are now "Phisosophers."

Oh. Oh. "Ph-phisosophers"? Nice.

- Philopol... Phiphophopher...
- Oh, my god.

Where did you learn to talk,
you grandpa-stealing slut?

I'm feeling...

[ RETCHES ]

Ugh.

Oh, man, let me help
all of you guys up.

ALL: I'm fine.

[DANCE MUSIC PLAYS]

[SNIFFS ] Do you know
what I love about you, Rick?

You're the only single mind
I've met

that really sees
the big picture.

You got that right.

But, baby, listen...

Y-you're talking about taking
over planets and galaxies.

You got to...
Got to just remember

to let go sometimes, you know?

I can let go. Hey, look.

You see that town

I want to have fun, classic
Rick-and-Morty adventures

like in the old days.

Then we'll get along fine,
Fascist Morty.

For starters, I just need to get
to Forbodulon Prime --

You will go
where I want you to go!!

Fuck.

Hey, hey! Ho, ho!

Not cloning your grandpa
has got to go!

Hey, hey! Ho, ho!

Not cloning your grandpa
has got to go!

You don't get out of my face,
I'm gonna flush Rick's DNA.

Alright.
Okay, regroup, everybody.

You, too, Berkeley!

Snap out of it.

At least tell me
what this death is

that you're
so determined to...

Oh. Jessica.

Morty, I love --

What?! No, no!
No, no, no!

I love you.

Damn it!

How am I gonna die with her
if I can't even talk to her?

Here's an idea, Morty.
Throw that thing in the garbage,

stop planning your own death,
and talk to whoever you want.

Now you just sound
like Real Rick.

You're better than
that language, Morty.

I ain't better than shit,
Jack.

So, uh,
w-what are we doing?

Stop asking questions.
Stop doing meta-commentary.

Just have fun.

We're going on a simple,
fun, classic adventure.

Okay, you know what?
It would really help

if you could just say anything
other than what you don't want.

I like Mr. Meeseeks.

Okay, now we're talking.
You know what?

I usually keep a Meeseeks box
in my glove compartment,

so maybe Fascist Rick
does, too.

other one more.

What was his name? Kyle?

What? Nothing.

Can we just sign
this thing and go?

Jessica, -I-I'm so sorry.
- I mean, it's fine.

You were only gone
like a couple minutes.

Morty, are you okay?

I'm -- I'm sorry, Jessica.

We just never seem
to get it right, do we?

No, I guess we don't.

But I'm glad you called me.

Maybe we can start
over, get it right this time.

Yeah. I'd -- I'd like that.

Thanks for bringing the wine.

Totally worth it.

Do we need an opener?

Oh. I'll -- I'll
-- I'll go get it.

Mmm.

I do so love to sign
upon the dotted line.

Shall we? Jesus Christ, yes.

And who is your witness?

My witness is the squid.

Really proud of this
SeaWorld theme, aren't you?

Hey, just get a witness, man.
Don't make this about me.

Or perhaps Richard has no one

with whom he can trust his life.

Who truly knows him.

Save me. Fine!

I'll get someone. Oh, my God.

Morty! C'mere. I need
you for some bullshit.

Look, Rick, I've done
everything you've asked.

Now can I just have some
time with my girlfriend?

Your girlfriend?

I mean, she's not -- we kissed,

but I'm just trying
to take it slow.

You gotta give these things
time to breathe, y'know?

Do you know why
you're special, Adam?

Because I am -The Traveler?
- Yes.

You will be the one to
pass through the door.

You will be the
one to end our pain.

But, Mother, what about my pain?


Faster?
Good idea, Morty.

It'll get us through these
asteroids sooner.

Geez, you're really thispissed
about my mom making sure

I'm okay
with our adventures?

What's next, Morty?
What if I want you to jump off

- the Empire State Building? I have to ask?
- Yes?

And you seriously don't see how
that's a slippery slope?

Just shut up and help me
with these, please.

Why are they called
death crystals?

D-Do they kill you?

You're thinking of bullets,
Morty.

Death crystals show you
how you're gonna die.

Jesus Christ!
I-I die a million times?

Your future stems from
your present,

which, if you're living right,
keeps changing.

Truth is, anyone that knows how
they're definitely gonna die

is either boring as hell
or about to get shot.

Duck!

Who are those guys?!

Crystal poachers.

There's no lower form
of life.

They think the galaxy's
their own personal piggy bank.

Wait, then what are we?

We're Rick and Morty.

You're about to witness the only
real use for these crystals.

They show you when
the other guy's reloading.

Certain death, certain death,
certain death, uncertain death.

And certain death,
certain death, certain death.

Definitely gonna get shot
by this guy;

this is totally my fate;
nothing I could possibly do;

okay, now,
not so much.

Help me gather these up.

You just use these
to win fights? Idon't use them.

People that spend their life
avoiding death are already dead.

They're also rich, and I like to
spend my life with their money.

Oh, my God. Morty!
Take your time!

Now that's what
I'm talking about!

If ya nail this next one,
I've got bird quaaludes.

And I might even share.

Y-You know you can stop
doing that for my benefit.

Y'know or-or keep doing
it. Doesn't matter. I'm out.

- I'm walking away.
- Wait. Morty. Don't go.

Not until you see this!

Commence bird on a wire!

Yeeeeaaaahhhhh!

Jerk.

Hey, let's hang out.

We're like brothers now,
we both got away y'know,

w-where are you at?

Ooh, you know
what, shoot, can't.

I'm an alien, um,
so --That's okay,

Rick turned my
bike into a spaceship

for "solo adventures"
like picking up

his Venusian foot ointment.

God I'm seeing
it so clearly now.

Oh. Wait. I-It says
here you're on Earth.

Yeah. Ah. Don't
come here. Why not?

Look, I-I get it, my room
is sometimes messy too,

I'll-I'll pick you up
right outside your...

- ...mental asylum.
- Busted.

You literally said "I'm free."

I'm literally not free.

Stop! That's my blanket!

How do you know Rick?

Look I came to your
place with him one night

after the bar closed.

I started messing
around in your garage

and I spilled that portal
stuff on me and he...

kind of launched
me to Australia...

like with this weirdly
primitive catapult, but --

but the ammunition is an
airtight carbon chamber,

yeah, that-that -- that's
how we lost our cable guy.

Anyways, that kind of
experience shakes you up.

You don't want to find
your own little hatch?

Jerry, I believe that,
if you hide by yourself,

you might survive
and I believe I,

by myself, have a shot
of getting out of here,

but the two of us, together?

I don't know.

Look, maybe the shrink
was right.

Good luck.

[ ROAR ]

All right, now,
you listen to me.

Oh! Or don't.

Hey! Don't! Please!

[ HISSING ]

[ WHINING ]

Oh, god, oh, god, oh, god!

Now, I know I've said,
in the past,

that math is important...
And it is!...

But I also think that,
one day, you'll all look back

on being in high school
with Tiny Rick and Morty,

who I hear had a great
party last night.

So, class dismissed.
You've got the day off!

All right! Good work,
Mr. Goldenfold!

Yeah, get outside. Read a book.

Put on some sunscreen, Danielle!

Hey, what's up, Summer?
Ooh, nice top.

Thanks. Tiny Rick,
you think you might be

getting back into
your old body tonight?

No can do.
Tonight's the big dance.

And Morty's bringing Jessica.
He needs his tiny wing man.

- BOTH: Tiny Rick!
- [ LAUGHS ]

Okay, but if not tonight, when?

I don't know.
When I feel like it?

Damn, girl!
You need to chill out!

This whole thing was your
idea, in the first place,

and, now, you're trying
to rush it along.

Yeah, and you know what?
I like high school.

I like hanging out. Tiny Rick!

But what if the you
that likes it isn't you?
Mr. Poopybutthole.

Well, what do you know
about this?

You're not in any of mine.

All I have are pictures of me
and my friends from school.

What? What teenage girl
has pictures of her family?

It's not like we're
Mormon or dying.

I will admit it's suspicious
that Summer's only friend

is a magic ballerina lamb
that we've never seen.

Summer!

Tinkles!

It's past my bedtime.
[ GIGGLES ]

Not in Never Past Bedtime Land!

Here we go!

- Summer, we're trying to sleep.

It was Tinkles!

Tinkles?

That is su... [BELCHES]...
Suspicious.

We're always hearing about
this Tinkles character,

- But we never get to...
- Hi, everybody.

I'm Tinkles,
and these are my friends.

[ ALL SIGH ]

See, everyone? Tinkles is real.

That means so am I.

- Sorry, Summer.
- Man, I'm sorry, Summer.

I was on the wrong side
of the pitchfork on this one.

Okay, look, we shouldn't need
evidence or logic

to know who's family
and who isn't.

I know who the Smiths are.


Oh!

Ooh!

Wow, okay! Looks like
you guys just got the nod.

The nod?

Mr. Nimbus has a
sense for these things.

I take it you're a
sex-positive couple?

Oh, yeah. Very much so.

- We watch porn together.
- Great!

I'll mark you down as
eligible for a threeway.

Here's all the
information you'll need.

The king of the ocean wants
to have a threesome with us?

Totally optional.

But a remarkable option to
have, I assure you. Very jealous.

There's a form on the last page

so we know where
to send the gift basket.

So that just happened.

You don't sound upset about it.

Neither do you.

Oh, my God. Is this
happening? To us?

I thought this only happened
in New York or on HBO.

Dr. Wong hasn't been wrong yet.

You're right.

This is exactly what
she was talking about.

So, uh, yeah. J-Just
make yourself comfortable.

Y'know, ch-choose a
movie or -- or we can watch

some interdimensional
cable if you want.

are you doing to me?

Or we can watch
whatever, y'know.

Wh-Whatever you're into.

Morty, did I hear
you're getting wine?

Yeah, I gotta get some
wine for Mr. Nimbus.

Got any extra?

Oh. Uh, yeah.

Yeah, yeah, I'll go
get some, just for you.

Cool. Hurry back.

Looks like you could use a hand.

Oh, hey! Yeah,
th-th-that'd be great.

No problem. Hoovy?
Dinner's ready!

Be right there, sugar hoof!


According to who...
other versions of you?

If I've learned one thing,

it's that before you get
anywhere in life,

you got to stop listening
to yourself.

Wow.
You really are wise, Jerry.

I-I-I guess that's why you work
in advertising.

The fact that you feel that way

makes you the best Rick
of them all.

You don't care about me at all!

I'm no different than that
jacket you've got on!

Y-Y-Y... o-or your stupid
portal gun!

I'm just a tool!
I-I-I'm just an object!

Hey, it's your choice
to take it personally, Morty.

Now, for the love of god,
be quiet.

The point of this is to get
the drop on the guy.

You know what, Rick?
I'll tell you something!

I'm more than a human shield!
- Yeah, that's right. You are.

You're a perfect, impenetrable
suit of human armor, Morty,

because you're as dumb
as I am smart,

which is why when I say
[BURPS] "shut up,"

it's really good advice.

[ WHIRRING ]

Great. Nice work, Morty.

[ GROANS ]

[ HANDS CLAP SLOWLY ]

Ooh. Look at you, C-137.

You... aren't you
a tough customer?

The slow clap? Really?
Kind of played out, dude.

Not in this dimension, it isn't.

In fact [CHUCKLES]
I invented it.

Nobody else has ever even
done it here before.

Well, la-Di-DA.

Hey, that's mine!

I don't like the look
of that Rick, Morty.

- We gotta escape.
- I'm not gonna help you, Rick.

Y-You're a monster.

Don't be rick-diculous,
Morty.

Will you stop saying that?
Jerry, uh, about down there --

It's okay, Rick, you
don't have to say it.

No, I do. I'll replace
you next time.

Make no mistake.

What just transpired
will never happen again.

10-4, captain.

Oh, wow, it's late.

We should get back to the kids.

home. We have to go.

- I have to shower.

Sorry, I farted.

product, Hellamic Sauce.

Hey, guys. We're home.
How was your night?

Tight. - Breezy.
- Chill.

You kids get into any trouble?

Nope. You sure?

Yup.

Is that a skull?

No, it's a baby's skull.

That's worse. It's
still a school night.

Yo, I just want
to tell you guys,

                                              since it opened,

but I've never been able
to participate.

Happy to help... Rose.

[ GIGGLES ]

I love watching bukkake.

I mean, like, I don't know if I
personally would ever do it...

- Brad! Hey!
- Yo.

Brad is here! Quick, make
my hair look drunk.

Check it out.
Tammy's already drunk.

Cool.

The beacon was activated.
and never really be complete.

FEMALE PRESIDENT:
But I know how it goes with us.

I lose who I am
and become part of you.

Because in a strange way,

you're better at what I do
without even trying.

Yours, and nobody else's, Unity.

P.S., I don't know where
those coal miners were

before they were assimilated.

You might want to get checked.

Man: [ BELCHES] [ LAUGHTER]

[ DOOR OPENS, CLOSES ]

Hey.

Dad.

[ CLEARS THROAT]
I, um... Jerry and I

were looking for
our weed whacker

and found your subterranean lair

and your alien prisoner,

and he got away.

And I know I sound like mom,

but I can't sacrifice
this whole family's safety

just because I'm afraid
you'll leave again,

so no more alien prisoners

and no more
subterranean excavation

without consulting us.

Okay, - Okay?

"Okay"... like you're gonna
quietly teleport somewhere

and never come back?
No. It's your house.

Grandpa Rick,
what happened with Unity?

Who? Oh, Unity. Yeah, well...

I mean, honestly,
we're talking about an entity

that thrives on
enslavement, you know?

It's not cool. Fun's fun,
but who needs it?

I'll be in the garage.

[ GROANS ] What did you guys do?

We put you in a dog crate
because you were acting crazy

and you caused
another time fracture.

You tried to kill yourself.

O-only in self-defense.

Myself tried to kill me first.

Guys, I don't expect you
to understand this,

but time breaking twice
means our problem is

two times bigger and we've got
half as much time to solve it.

Well, actually, I do expect
you to understand that.

It's basic math. C-can somebody
just let me out of here?

If I die in a cage,
I lose a bet.

Well, is there some way
you can prove

you're not a threat to yourself
and others anymore?

Oh, for god's sake.
All right, here.

- Give me the time crystal.
- Wh-what are you doing?

Calling myself. Here, listen.

It'll [BURPS] probably go
to voicemail

since, you know,
I'm calling myself.

Hello, Rick here.

Don't fall for it. It's a bit.

Just kidding! Ha, ha!

You just got Ricked.

You've reached Rick's voicemail.

You know what to do. [ BEEP]

Hey, Rick. It's Rick.

Listen, I'm sorry about earlier.
No hard feelings.

I know you know I mean it, too.
Take it easy.

Whoa, damn! Look at this.

I'm blowing up...
Three new voicemails.

Hey, Rick. It's Rick.

Listen, I'm sorry about earlier.

Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I heard this one.

Hey, Rick. It's Rick.

Hey, Rick, it's...
You get the idea.

[ BURPS ] W-we're cool now.

Okay, well, we're still not
gonna let you out of this crate.

Fine. I'll just do it myself.

If you could get out that whole
time, why didn't you?

here for an incredibly urgent reason.

Well, it's lunch.

I mean, it's one of three meals
that have existed for millennia.

[ FLATLINE ] Losing him.

[ BEEPS ] Stabilized.

Okay, I only ask, Jerry,
because, as you know,

my job involves
performing heart surgery.

Well, yeah, on horses.

Excuse me?

Okay. Let's not
rehash that fight.

I sense that you're busy
and will now be on my way.

Whoa!

What is this on the floor?

Some kind of literature for
a really nice-looking nursing home.

Hey, honey, crazy idea...
bad pitch...

let's put your Dad here.

Let's put your Dad
in a nursing home.

[ FLATLINE ]

We're losing him.

Hey, Tom.

We know when we're losing him.

We can hear the beeps!

There she is. All right.

Come on, Morty.
Let's go.

Oh, geez.

Okay.

Oh, man, Rick.

What is this place?

It's dimension 35C,
and it's got the perfect

climate conditions for a
special type of tree, Morty,

called a Mega tree,

and there's fruit
in those trees,

and there's seeds
in those fruits.

I'm talking about Mega seeds.

They're... [BURPING] they're
incredibly powerful,

and I need them to help me
with my research, Morty.

Oh, man, Rick. I'm looking
around this place,

and I'm starting to work up some
anxiety about this whole thing.

All right. All right.
Calm down.

Listen to me, Morty.

I know that new situations
can be intimidating.
you enough space,


you'd outgrow this... phase.


Here's your drink, poser.


Dad got sick, you know. Stage 4.


You would've loved it.


Summer's a nurse --
well, pretty much a nurse.


She -- She married a junkie.


Rick, come home,


while we still
got a little time.


Morty, what we
had wasn't healthy.


And this is?


Y-You've had a thousand
adventures with these crows.


When are you gonna
kill their big bad?


First off, the
"will they/kill they"


is everything to my guys.


And second, fuck you for trying
to undermine my happiness.


This may be the last time
you ever lay eyes on me!


I hope that's not true, Morty,


because you look like sshit,


and this is not how I
wanna remember you.


Now that I have his two crows,


nothing will stop me from
eliminating Crow Rick.


Don't defend him to me.


I don't even get
what you see in him.


You're right.


We should be enjoying
the time we have together.


Crow Rick!


Oh, I-I know what this
must look like, but --


It looks like my arch
nemesis, Crow Scare,

You may have created
this universe, Rick,

- but I live in it.
- Shit!

What are we gonna do, Rick?
We're so screwed.

He's gonna get to the ship
and smash the microverse,

and then he's gonna kill us!

Quick, Morty, you've got
to turn into a car.

- What?!
- A long time ago...

I implanted you with
a subdermal chip that could

call upon dormant nanobots
in your bloodstream

to restructure your anatomy
and turn you into a car.

- Oh, my god!
- Concentrate, Morty.

Concentrate and turn
into a car, Morty.

[ GRUNTS ]

Never mind. Here's a taxi.
Get in. It's fine.

Six...

- Hey, Zeep.
- Huh?

Happy Ricksgiving, biiiiiitch.

Aaah!

We did it, Morty.

Now let's get out of here
and destroy this whole universe.

Excuse me?

- Five...
- Sir?

[ SPIDERS HISS ]

- Holy hell.
- Sir!

[ TIRES SCREECH ]

Hold your fire!

[ SPIDER SNARLS ]

What's going on?

FEMALE VOICE: I have brokered
a peace agreement

between the giant spiders
and the government.

Thanks to the skilled diplomacy
of this mysterious space car,

from this day forward,
human and spiderkind will live

side by side in peace.

We will stop bombing them,

and they will no longer use
their telepathic abilities

to make us wander into webs
for later consumption.

Instead, we will work together

to make this world
a better place for all,

no matter how many legs.
