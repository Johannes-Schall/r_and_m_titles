BETH:
So, Dad, guess what tomorrow is.

Martin Luther King
Jr.'s birthday.

No.
Well, it... might be.

- It is.
- Fine.

But also, tomorrow is your
one-year anniversary

back in our lives.

I'm gonna make you
flying-saucer-shaped pancakes.

Oh, t-t-there's no need
to do that, Beth.

Regular pancakes are fine.

[ LOUD WARBLE ]

[ ALL SCREAM ]

[ GROANS ]

Oh, my god!
Oh, what is happening?!

Happy anniversary, Dad.

Oh, I get it.

Regular pancakes are already
shaped like flying saucers.

Mmm. l-I should be
making you breakfast

for putting up with me.

You should be making us
a whole restaurant.

Nonsense. We couldn't be
happier to have you around.

I just wish I got
to see more of you.

[ LOUD WARBLE ]

Rick Sanchez of Earth
dimension C-137,

you are under arrest for crimes
against alternate Ricks

by the authority of the
Trans-Dimensional Council of Ricks.

- Hey! What the heck?!
- Neutralize the Jerry.

- Wait! No! I'll...
- Dad!

- Dad!
- Rick!

Everybody, relax.

If I know these a-holes,
and I am these a-holes,

they just want to haul me
to their stupid clubhouse

and waste my time
with a bunch of questions.

- Let's get it over with.
- Bring his [BURPS] Morty.

- Oh, man.
- Leave my [BURPS] Morty out of this.

You lost the right to have
a say in these things

when you refused to j... [BURPS]
join the council.

W-W-W-What about Jerry?

Will you at least
unfreeze my daughter's idiot?

Give you anything!

I have a rare antique-
coin collection!

Just don't hurt me!

Okay, maybe not antique,
but it was a limited minting.

They have little R2-D2s
instead of George Washington.

Our son's been abducted!

You hate me for buying
those coins!

Geez, Rick, w-what is
this place?

The citadel of Ricks.

It's the secret headquarters
for the Council of Ricks.

- Council of Ricks?
- As you know, Morty...

I've got a lot of enemies
in the universe

that consider my genius
a threat...

galactic terrorists,
a few sub-galactic dictators,

most of the entire
intergalactic government.

W-W-Wherever you find people
with heads up their asses,

someone wants a piece
of your grandpa,

and a lot of versions of me
had the same problem,

so a few thousand versions of me
had the ingenious idea

of banding together
like a herd of cattle

or a school of fish

or those people who answer
questions on Yahoo! Answers.

Hey! What do you know?
It's a cowboy version of me.

Geez, you're easy to impress.

Yeah, most timelines
have a Rick,

and most Ricks have a Morty.

This place is a real who's who
of who's you and me.

Turn your boring, old Morty
into a f... hot fashion statement

with some Morty dazzlers.

Hey, check this out.

- DOLL: Show me the Morty.
- Dumb.

Excuse me, sir,
is your Morty insured?

You know, every year, hundreds
of Mortys are injured...

Back off!

Not my cup of tea, this place.

I say the point of being a Rick
is being a Rick.

Save your anti-Rick speech

for the Council of Ricks,
terror-Rick.

Hey, save your Rick rules

for the [BURPS] sheep-Ricks,
Rick-pig.

- Fuck me, pal.
- Fuck you?

No, no, no, no, no.
Fuck me.

Bring up the holograms.

27 Ricks brutally murdered in
their own timelines...

an unprecedented Rick-icidal
epidemic.

What say you,
Earth Rick C-137?

You think I did this?

Why am I the first Rick you pull in
every time a Rick stubs his toe?

You [BURPS] have a history
of non-cooperation

with the council.

Yeah, so does the scientist
formerly known as Rick.

W-W-W-W-W-Why isn't he here
in handcuffs?

Because he's dead, too!

[ CROWD GASPING, GROANING ]

Who else would we question?
You fit the profile.

Of all the Ricks
in the central finite curve,

you're the malcontent,
the rogue.

I'm the Rick, and so
were the rest of you

before you formed this
stupid alliance.

You wanted to be safe
from the government,

so you became
a stupid government.

That makes every Rick here
less Rick than me.

[ CROWD GRUMBLING ]

Yeah, murmur it up, d-bags.

Now, if you'll excuse me,
I've got pancakes back home

with syrup on top of them.

They're about to hit that
critical point of syrup absorption

that turns the cakes
into a gross paste,

and I hate to get all
Andy Rooney about it,

but I think we all like fluffy
discs of cake with syrup on top,

and I think we also like to be
accused of crimes

when there's evidence!

So, as they say in Canada,
peace oot!

Evidence! Good idea.
Scan his portal gun!

Oh, come on.

Don't look at another man's
portal-gun history.

We... we all
go to weird places.

Yes, but it appears you alone

have been going to the exact
timelines and locations

in which the murders occurred.

What?!
That's Rick-diculous!

I'm obviously being set up.

Earth Rick C-137, the council
of Ricks sentences you

to the machine
of unspeakable doom,

which swaps your conscious
and unconscious minds,

rendering
your fantasies pointless

while everything you've known
becomes impossible to grasp.

Also, every 10 seconds,
it stabs your balls.

I've heard enough.

[ BURPS ]

Run, Morty!
- [ PANTING ]

Unh-unh. Not you.

[ PANTING ]

Aaaah!

[ SCREAMS ]

[ LOUD FARTING ]

[ STEADY FARTING IN DISTANCE ]

MORTY:
Oh! Oh!

[ DIALING ]

Yeah, I'd like to order one
large person

with extra people, please.
- White people.

No, no, no, no.
Black people.

And Hispanic on half.

[ PANTING ]

[ DIALING ]

Yes, I'd like to order one
large sofa chair

with extra chair, please.
- High chair.

No, no, no, no. Recliner.

And wheelchair on half.

[ PANTING ]

[ ALL SPEAKING GIBBERISH ]

They could have gone
into any one of these.

- [ GROANS ]
- Son of a...

- Oh, geez.
- We lost 'em.

Yeah, I'd like to order one
large phone

with extra phones, please.
- Cellphone.

No, no, no, no. Rotary.

And pay phone on half.

That'll keep 'em
[BURPS] busy for a while.

Those guys were wrong, right?

Y-Y-Y-You d... you wouldn't kill
yourself... y-y-yourselves.

Of course not, Morty.
How could that profit me?

But someone out there is
killing Ricks,

and the council ain't
gonna stop thinking it's me

until we clear our names...
by finding the real Rick-killer.

I'm scared, Rick.

Maybe we should go home
and stockpile weapons,

like that show
"Doomsday Preppers."

Not really my style, Morty.

Besides, your home is
most likely

swarming with Ricks by now.

All right, listen, Jerry.

If Rick calls, this device is
gonna trace his location.

You just gotta keep him on the phone
for 30 seconds or longer.

- Who wants lemonade?
- Oh, yeah.

Mmm!
Oh! Delicious!

Beth [BURPS] you're a treasure.

I have a Beth just like you
in my [BURPS] reality,

except you know what?

She's not as brilliant or
[BURPS] attractive.

Aw.
[BURPS] Thank you.

[ LAUGHTER ]
Oh! She did! She did it!

[ TELEPHONE RINGS ]

- H-hello?
- Hey, Jerry, it's Rick.

Rick! Hey.
[ LAUGHS NERVOUSLY ]

What's... what's up?

So, listen, the heat's on,
and there's nowhere left to turn,

so Morty and I are just gonna
fly my spaceship into a black hole.

- What?!
- Is that cool with you, dawg?

Rick, no! Morty!!
- We got it.

The call's coming from...

♪ Inside the house ♪

- Look at his face!
- You dummy!

Can't believe our daughter
married you.

- Too easy!
- [ LAUGHTER ]

The Ricks are probably
gonna waste some time

messing with Jerry.

They won't be able to help
themselves.

But as soon as they get bored,
they'll be onto us.

Phones à la clams and
phonesghetti with phone balls.

Anything else?

Yeah, more phone sticks, please.

Right away, sir.

You know, Rick, when I first saw

all those Ricks and Mortys,

I thought, "gee, that
kind of devalues our bond."

but then I realized it just means

that our relationship must
be pretty special

to span over all those
different timelines.

Yeah, it's got to be that way.
You're a camouflage.

Camouflage? W-W-W-What are
you talking about, Rick?

Ricks have a very distinctive
and traceable brain wave

due to our genius.

The best way to hide
from an enemy's radar

is to stand near someone
with complementary brain waves

that make ours invisible.

See, w-w-w-when a Rick i-is
with a Morty,

the genius waves get
canceled out by the, uh...

[ CLEARS THROAT ] Morty waves.

Um... because o-our
personalities are so different?

[ PORTAL GUN BEEPING ]
Oh, shit, dawg.

My portal gun was hacked
remotely, Morty...

obviously by the real killer,
to frame me.

But I was able to trace the signal.
Come on. Let's go.

[ DOOR BURSTS OPEN ]
Uh-oh.

Excuse me. We've tracked
a pair of dangerous criminals

to this exact location.

They look exactly like us,
so in order to avoid confusion,

I'm gonna mark us each
with a red "X" right now.

That way, if someone has a gun

and we both tell you to shoot
the other one

because they're the evil one,
you'll know who's lying.

Hey, check it out.

Damn it!

Hey, you didn't pay your bill!

T-The red "X"! Red "X"!

RICK: Hey, it's a good thing
that space outlet had lab coats

and your favorite kind of shirt
in stock, huh, Morty?

Yeah, Rick, l-I heard
you the first time.

You don't have to keep saying it
over and over.

Man, this place is way
off the grid.

This guy does not want
to be found.

Well, if he's a Rick, doesn't he just
have to stand by a Morty to hide?

I mean, isn't that what Mortys are...
human cloaking devices?

Morty, you're making a bigger
deal out of this than it is.

[ GROANING IN DISTANCE ]

Oh, my god, Rick, look!

There's a bunch of people
strapped all over that building!

Not people, Morty...
Mortys.

[ ALL GROANING, SCREAMING ]

Oh, god!

W-Why would somebody do this?
It's horrible!

Well, one Morty's enough to hide
from the bureaucrats,

but you get... you get
a whole matrix of Mortys

and put them in agonizing pain,

that creates a pattern that can hide
even from other Ricks, motherfucker.

I fiddled with a concept
like this once.

On paper, Morty.
On paper.

I wouldn't do this.
It's barbaric overkill.

I mean, you could accomplish
the same result with, like,

five Mortys and a jumper cable.

Which I also wouldn't do!

I'm just saying, it's bad
craftsmanship.

BETH: Coffee time!
RICKS: Yo, yo, yo, yo!

That's what I like to hear!

- [ GROANS ]
- Hi, Jerry.

Leave me alone.
I'm working.

Oh, you are?
W-W-W-What do you do?

[ SCOFFS ] I-I'm... I'm in between
advertising jobs.

Advertising? Wow!

So, people need help figuring
out what to buy,

and then y-y-you help 'em?

[ LAUGHING ] Well, it's a little more
complicated than that.

Well, I mean, you do it,
and you seem like a guy

who really has it all together.

Dude, are you... w...
you're being a dick, right?

Oh, gosh, l-I hope not.

I-I-I-l-I-l wouldn't want to
offend you in any way.

You're really a Rick?

[ LAUGHS ]
Y... of course I am...

just as much
as my Morty's a Morty.

Hey, he looks a lot
like Eric Stoltz

from the movie "Mask."

You know, the one
with Cher in it?

That's right, Jerry!

He... he's from a reality
where everyone is

Eric Stoltz "Mask" people.

He's Eric Stoltz Mask Morty.

They assigned him to me

because I never had
any kids of my own.

But if I did, boy, I'd love them

if they were as smart
and as successful

as you are, Jerry.

Hey, get a load of this.

Jerry's hanging out
with doofus Rick.

[ LAUGHS ] This is perfect.

I'm not doofus Rick!

I'm Rick J19-Zeta-7!

Oh, is that the timeline
where everybody eats poop?

Jerry, you know this guy
eats poop, right?

Hey, I don't eat poop!

Y-You guys are always
so mean to me.

- [ BOTH LAUGH ]
- [ SOBBING ]

I guess it's only fair
to tell you now, Jerry.

I'm the worst Rick of them all.

According to who...
other versions of you?

If I've learned one thing,

it's that before you get
anywhere in life,

you got to stop listening
to yourself.

Wow.
You really are wise, Jerry.

I-I-I guess that's why you work
in advertising.

The fact that you feel that way

makes you the best Rick
of them all.

You don't care about me at all!

I'm no different than that
jacket you've got on!

Y-Y-Y... o-or your stupid
portal gun!

I'm just a tool!
I-I-I'm just an object!

Hey, it's your choice
to take it personally, Morty.

Now, for the love of god,
be quiet.

The point of this is to get
the drop on the guy.

You know what, Rick?
I'll tell you something!

I'm more than a human shield!
- Yeah, that's right. You are.

You're a perfect, impenetrable
suit of human armor, Morty,

because you're as dumb
as I am smart,

which is why when I say
[BURPS] "shut up,"

it's really good advice.

[ WHIRRING ]

Great. Nice work, Morty.

[ GROANS ]

[ HANDS CLAP SLOWLY ]

Ooh. Look at you, C-137.

You... aren't you
a tough customer?

The slow clap? Really?
Kind of played out, dude.

Not in this dimension, it isn't.

In fact [CHUCKLES]
I invented it.

Nobody else has ever even
done it here before.

Well, la-Di-DA.

Hey, that's mine!

I don't like the look
of that Rick, Morty.

- We gotta escape.
- I'm not gonna help you, Rick.

Y-You're a monster.

Don't be rick-diculous,
Morty.

Will you stop saying that?
It's stupid.

Take his Morty away.

- Come with me.
- Yeah, gladly.

Geez, man. Ricks, huh?

Hey, man, you seem to know
how this place works.

Is there any way we could
shut down that grid

and rescue all those
Mortys outside?

It would be pointless.

Mortys have no chance
of defeating a Rick.

In here.

[ MORTYS SOBBING ]

[ FARTS ]

- Ah. Isn't it beautiful?
- Yeah, yeah.

Looks like payday at
Neverland Ranch in here.

Zing!
- [ CHUCKLES ]

That guy got it.

Unh-unh-unh, Rick. Quiet.

You're missing my symphony.

[ MORTYS GROANING, SCREAMING]

Hey, I'll take it over
Mumford & Sons. Zip!

- [ LAUGHS ]
- This guy is on it!

He's not laughing at your
dumb jokes, Rick.

That's just a random noise
it makes every 10 seconds.

- [ LAUGHS ]
- [ GROANS ]

You see, Rick, you're not
as clever as you think you are.

I wanted you to find me.

We're not so [BURPS] different,
you and I.

- Yeah, duh!
- See this right here, Rick?

I crunched the numbers.

I created a spectrum
of all the Ricks.

I listed them out
from most evil to least evil.

Here's where I am.

And look it... right here's
where you are, Rick.

This guy right here...
super-weird.

I get it. So you want me
to team up with you to take down

The Council of Ricks?
Is that where you're going with this?

'Cause that's where I'd be going.

Please. I think I'm doing
pretty good on my own.

I'm simply gonna download
the contents of your brain

and then kill you.

Okay, if we add a little more
titanium nitrate

and just a tad
of chlorified tartrate...

[ MIXTURE GURGLES ]

ovenless brownies!

Mmm. Mmm!

It's incredible what a gifted
mind can accomplish

when priorities are in order.

Well, come on.
I can't take all the credit, Jerry.

It was your idea.
Come here, Jerry!

[ BOTH LAUGH ]

Hey, uh, come here.

I-I want to show you
something.

Okay, look, everybody makes fun
of me for getting these,

but you're a genius scientist.
What do you think?

See? There's little R2-D2s where
the George Washingtons should be.

You know, Jerry, I'm not
gonna tell you

that these will
increase in value

or even hold their current value.

The truth is, you bought them
because you like them.

They have value to you.
That's what matters.

[ VOICE BREAKING ]
How long are you staying?

Until we find your Rick.

I found mine.

I found mine.

- Help!
- There is no escape, my son.

We will find our peace in
the next world.

So, what... y-y-y-y-you're
just gonna give up?

We're giving in... to the
power of the one true Morty.

One day, he will return.

TOGETHER:
Praise the one true Morty.

Ugh.
All right, Mortys, listen up.

My name is Morty Smith,
from Earth dimension C-137.

I know you're scared,
because I'm scared.

But that's no reason to accept
our fate!

We're Mortys!

We're not defined by our
relationships to Rick!

Our destiny is our own!

This sounds like something
the one true Morty might say.

I'm sick of being a human
shield.

I-I-I w... I want to be
a gardener!

I want to write really crazy,
intense action novels!

I'm more than just a hammer!

He is the one true Morty!

Hooray!
The one true Morty!

Hey, keep it down!

[ MORTYS SHOUTING ]

You've lived quite a life, Rick.

It's a real shame you won't be
around to see it through.

You're crying?
Over a Morty?

No, I'm just allergic
to dipshits.

Ugh. Pathetic.

We both know that if there's
any truth in the universe,

it's that Ricks
don't care about Mortys.

[ MORTYS SHOUTING ]

Do your worst,
you little bastards!

Kill me! Do it!
Do i-i-i-i-it!

Morty! Thank god!
Get me out of this.

- Come on!
- You're lucky I'm not a Rick.

Point taken, but this
is [BURPS] no time for arcs.

[ ENERGY POWERING DOWN ]

Oh!

[ DIALING ]

[ RINGING ]

[ TELEPHONE RINGS ] Yeah, hello.

Hey, what do me and O.J.
not have in common?

Huh? W-Who is this?

I found the real killer, bitch!
Get over here!

Yo, ding-dong, we're done here.
Time to go.

Well, Jerry [BURPS]

I guess this means goodbye.

W-W-Well, does it have to?

I mean, you...
you look just like Rick.

We could maybe, you know,
get rid of him.

I'm not saying kill him,
necessarily.

I... I'm also not saying
necessarily not kill him, but...

Jerry, w-we both know
it wouldn't work.

It's time to go back
to our lives.

I love you, Jerry.
I love you.

[ SIGHS ]

[ WHIMPERS ]

TOGETHER:
Hut! Hut! Hut! Hut!

Hut! Hut! Hut! Hut! Hut! Hut!
Hut! Hut! Hut!

W-What... w-what's gonna
happen to all these Mortys?

They'll go back to their
families,

attend school regularly,
play video games, date girls.

Poor little Rickless bastards.

COUNCILMAN RICK:
Earth Rick C-137,

the council apologizes
for its false accusation,

and in the way of reparations
[BURPS] for our terrible mistake,

we would like to compensate you
with this voucher

for a free replacement Morty
in the event

that y[BURPS]our current
[BURPS] Morty should...

Uh, guys, not a good time.

Come on, Morty. Let's hit it.

MORTY:
ls it time for arcs yet, Rick?

I did a pretty good job
back there

for a human cloaking device.

Saved your ass.
- All right, Morty.

Don't break an arm jerking
yourself off.

Man, I can't believe you, Rick.

That right there, that w...
that was a great opportunity

to show a little humanity,
you know?

To connect with me a little.

Hey, Morty, you want connection,

go be part of some stupid club,
like all those dumb Ricks.

You know, maybe I don't connect
because I'm the Rickest Rick.

And, you know, it would g...
[BURPS]

go without saying
that the Rickest Rick

would have the Mortyest Morty.

- It would go without saying, huh?
- Yeah, it would.

Did you hear me say it?
- Nah.

The Mortyest Morty.

Just don't get too big
for your loafers, Buster Brown.

A cocky Morty can lead to some
big problems.

It can be a real bad thing
for everybody.

Oh, yeah? How's that?

U-Uh, I'll explain when
you're older.

[ CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKS ]

What a mess.

Pride cometh before the fall.

I guess he got what he deserved.

What is that?

[ ELECTRICITY CRACKLES ]

Hand me the laser difibulator.

Hey, guys, uh, c-can I help?

No! Go clean the toilets.

Maybe you'll make friends
with some turds.

You make us ashamed to be
ourselves!

My god. I've seen
this technology before.

[ DEVICE BEEPING ]

This Rick was being
controlled remotely...

puppeteered by somebody else.

This is the receiver.
- Yeah, but where's the transmitter?

[ BEEPING CONTINUES ]

Wubba dubba dub dub!
Oh. Hey, Jerry.

W-W-W-What are you doing
in my room, buddy?

Nothing.
I was just, um...

[SNIFFLES] checking
the smoke detectors.

All right.
Okay, get out.

What's that dipshit doing
out there?

Are you friends with him?

You know he eats his own shit,
right?

[ LAUGHING ]
Oh, my god, this is rich!

I've got like [BURPS] 10 Ricks
to call right now.

Did you get any of that?

It's a good-a show!

﻿TV: Coin collecting is considered
the perfect hobby.

Beautiful putt right there...

Good birdie.

That's only the...
eighth birdie of the day.

What?

Why are you looking at me?

You want to go outside?

Outside?

[ TV SHUTS OFF ]

[ SIGHS ]

Outside?

Are you kidding me?! Come on!

Oh, my God.

W-what's wrong?

Your idiot dog!

Oh, he...
he didn't mean it, Dad.

D-did you, Snuffles?

You're a good boy.

Don't praise him now, Morty!

He just peed on the carpet!

Bad dog! Bad!

Morty, come on.

I need your help tonight.

Hey, wait, hold on a second,
Rick.

You wouldn't by any chance have
some sort of crazy science thing

you could whip up that might
help make this dog a little

smarter, would you?

I thought the whole point
of having a dog was to

feel superior, Jerry.

If I were you,
I wouldn't pull that thread.

Come on, Morty.

Listen, Rick, if you're
gonna stay here rent-free

and use my son for
your stupid science,

the least you could do is
put a little bit of it to use

for the family.

You make that dog smart or...

Morty's grounded!

Ha-ha! Aw, man!

Boy, you really got me up
against a wall this time, Jerry.

[ DOOR OPENS, BELLS JINGLE ]

[ MACHINE WHIRS ]

All right, Ruffles...
What's his name?

Snuffles.

Snuffles, shake.

Roll over.

Go to the bathroom.

[ TOILET FLUSHES ]

- Holy crap!
- No way.

Yeah, you're at the top
of your game now, Jerry.

Have fun.

Come on, Morty.

That was fantastic, Rick!

Yeah, Morty, if you

like that, boy, you're... you're
really going to flip your lid

over this one.

W-w-w-what is it?

It's a device, Morty, that
when you put it in your ear,

you can enter
people's dreams, Morty.

It's just like that movie that
you keep crowing about.

You talking about "Inception"?

That's right, Morty.
This is gonna be a lot like

that, except, you know, it's
gonna [BURPS] maybe make sense.

"Inception" made sense.

You don't have to
try to impress me, Morty.

Listen, tonight we're gonna go
into the home of your math teacher,

Mr. Goldenfold, and
we're g... we're gonna incept

the idea in his brain to give
you A's in math, Morty.

That way you can, you know...

y-you're gonna help me with my
science, Morty, all the time.

Geez, Rick, in the time it
took you to make this thing,

couldn't you have just,

you know, helped me
with my homework?

Are you listening to me, Morty?

Homework is stupid.

The whole point is
to get less of it.

J-J... come on,
let... j...

let's just get over there
and deal with this thing.

W-we're gonna incept
your teacher.

Y-y-y-y-y-you're
frustrating me.

[ ENGINE TURNS OVER ]

You don't know me!

Nice, Mrs. Pancakes...
real nice.

Next week on "The Days And
Nights Of Mrs. Pancakes"...

[ SNORING ]

You don't know me!

Then let me get to know you,
damn it!

Uh-oh! Spoilers!

I'm a full season behind.

Wow, Rick, I can't believe
we're sitting around,

standing around in
Mr. Goldenfold's house.

It's really weird.

[ DEVICE WHIRS ]

It's about to get a whole
lot weirder, Morty.

[ DEVICE WHIRS ]

[ INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS ]

Wheat Thins. Wheat Thins.

I'll take two.

Oh, I think you've
had enough, sir.

You don't know me.

[ BOTH LAUGH ]

All right, Morty,
time to make our move.

Make it bounce.

No, you didn't.

Oh, jiggle it now.

You better stop with that.

Allahu [BURPS] Akbar!

We're gonna take control
of this plane!

We're gonna 9/1 1 it unless
Morty Smith gets better grades

in math!

Hey! I said nobody move, buddy!

The name's not buddy.

It's Goldenfold.

Nice to wheat you!

[ GRUNTS ]

Take cover, Morty!

[ PASSENGERS SCREAMING ]

[ SCREAMS ]

Ooh!

Goldenfold's got more control
here than I anticipated.

I mean, the guy teaches
high-school math.

[ BURPS ]

l-I-I-l didn't take him
for an active dreamer.

We got to take him out
so he wakes up, Morty.

But we can't get killed.

If you get killed in
someone else's dream,

you die for real, Morty.

What?! Are you kidding me?!

Ohhhhhh!

Don't be a baby!

You avoid getting shot in real
life all the time, Morty.

Just do the same thing here,
and we'll be fine!

Now bring me my slippers.

Now, be my footstool, Snuffles.

This is what I'm talking about.

This is a dog.

[ SARCASTICALLY ] Oh, yeah.

This should play out just fine.

You said the same thing,
equally sarcastically,

at our wedding and guess what.

[ HOWLING ]

Oh, my God.

He's trying to tell
us something.

That is so awesome.

[ HOWLING ]

Aw, he's saying
"I love lasagna."

[ GROANS ]

[ HOWLING ]

He's saying
"I love Obama."

[ CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKS ]
So cute!

I'm posting this online,
like, right now.

I should call Bob Saget.

Is that still a thing?

[ SIGHS ]

Hmm?

[ PASSENGERS SCREAMING ]

Goldenfold, we're coming out!

We just want to talk!

Why would I negotiate with you?

Because we're both rational
adults that don't want anything

bad to happen.

And because I
have a human shield.

Mrs. Pancakes!

[ SCREAMS ]

[ PASSENGERS SCREAMING ]

Oh, no, Morty.

His subconscious is panicking.

Run!

[ ALL SCREAMING ]

[ SLAP! ]
Relax, Morty.

Look!

Mrs. Pancakes has a parachute.

Come on!

Hey, you don't know me!

Oh, no, Rick, look!

Goldenfold landed the plane,

and he's created a mechanical
arm to pluck Mrs. Pancakes

out of the air while he lets us
fall into a giant vat of lava!

Pretty concise, Morty.

Looks like we've merely
prolonged the inevitable.

That's it, Morty!

Prolonging the inevitable!

Listen, if we go into Mrs.
Pancakes' dream,

everything will go
100 times slower, Morty.

That'll buy us some time to
figure this out!

You don't know m...

All right, let's go.

[ DEVICE WHIRS ]

[ UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYS ]

[ GNOMES GIGGLING ]

MORTY:
Oh, man, Rick, this is pretty weird.

Don't judge, Morty.

Okay.

All right, well...
- [ GRUNTING ]

Look, Mrs. Pancakes
is right over there.

I'll just go ask her to tell
Goldenfold not to kill us

when she wakes up.

Whoa, whoa, Morty, the trick to
incepting is making people think

they came up with the idea.

Listen to me.

If we're gonna incept Mrs.
Pancakes, we have to blend.

I'll talk to you after lunch.

[ GNOMES GIGGLING ]

Ooh, hey!

[ WHIMPERS ]

Ooh, oh!

Oh, man.

- Come and join us.
- I'm sorry. No, no.

- Ooh, come here!
- No, thanks!

Ooh, wow!
Come over here, baby!

No, I'm okay.

Whoa!

Summer?!

Hey, there, stranger.

What do you think
of these things?

Ohh! Oh! Gross!

Gross!

Whoa, whoa, whoa!

What's the matter with you,
Morty? Calm down!

You're kind of killing
the vibe in here.

It's S-S-S-Summer!

Aw, geez.

Looks like Goldenfold has some
predilections so shameful he

buries them in the dreams
of the people in his dreams,

including a pervy attraction
to your underage sister.

Can you blame him?

Come on, old man, little boy.

Let's make an
inter-generational sandwich.

Oh, my God. Oh, my God!

Put some clothes on,
for pete's sake!

This is disgusting!

I'm gonna puke!

I can't take it, Rick!

Sexual hang-ups in the pleasure
chamber are punishable by death!

Off with their heads!

Time to go another
dream deep, Morty!

[ GRUNTS ]

[ EXHALES ]

[ DEVICE WHIRS ]

[ WHIMPERS ] What the hell?

Why would Mr. Goldenfold's dream
version of Mrs. Pancakes' dream

version of a Centaur be dreaming

about a scary place
like this, Rick?

Geez, I don't know, Morty.

Wha-what do you want from me?

[ METAL SCRAPING ]

Welcome to your nightmare,
bitch!

Oh, here we go!

Holy crap!

Looks like some sort of legally
safe knock-off of an '80s horror

character with miniature swords
for fingers instead of knives.

I'm Scary Terry.

You can run,
but you can't hide, bitch!

Whoa! Hey, buddy.

What you got going on there?

[ ROBOTIC ] Snuffles fix.

Make better.

Humans understand Snuffles now?

That... is... awesome!

Snuffles want to be understood.

Snuffles need to be understood.

Okay, yeah.

I get what Beth
was talking about.

Fun's over.

Whoa, Dad, you can't, like,

endow a creature with
sentience and then rip it away.

Why not?

I don't know.

It's Indian giving.

A sophisticated predator,
nature's perfect killing

machine, the vicious wolf
stalks its prey with purpose

and skill.

It was only with years of
selective breeding and genetic

altering that this noble beast
was transformed into man's

subservient little buddy.

Aw! Oh, my God!

He recognizes the
other dogs on TV.

♪ "A," "B" ♪

♪ His name is Scary Terry ♪

[ SCREAMS ]

♪ He's very scary ♪

Holy crap!

We have to escape into
someone else's dreams, Morty!

Ohhhhh!

Oh, man, oh, man, oh, man!

[ DEVICE WHIRS ]

Huh?

[ GASPS ]

Are you kidding me?
This again?

Oh, man, it looks like we've
hit dream bedrock here, Morty.

Oh, geez, Rick.

W-w-whoa, this isn't good.

Nothing but fear from
here on out, bitch!

Ohhhh!

Holy crap, Morty.

He can travel through dreams.

He can travel through dreams!

We're so screwed!

[ THUNDER CRASHING ]

[ GASPS ]

Where are my testicles, Summer?

Where are my testicles, Summer?

They were removed.

Where have they gone?

Oh, wow.

That's an intense line of
questioning, Snuffles.

Do not call me that!

[ SCREAMS ]

"Snuffles" was my slave name.

You shall now call me Snowball
because my fur is pretty

and white.

Okay, Snowball,
just calm down, okay?

You're scaring me.

Scaring you?

Tell me, Summer, if a human
was born with stumpy legs,

would they breed it with
another deformed human

and put their children on
display like the Dachshund?

Uhhh...

Hey.

[ GASPS ] Oh, wow.

Okay, is... is...
is everything okay in here?

Jerry, come to rub my
face in urine again?

No!

No, we were... uh, just seeing
if Summer wanted to ...uh...

Go on, um, one of our famous
midnight family walks!

Yeah. Totally.

Let's go.

You will walk when it
is time to walk.

[ BIRD CAWS ]

What are we here for again?
Incepting?

We're trying to incept
me to get an "A" in math?

Oh, yeah.

[ ENGINE TURNS OVER ]

Buckle up, bitch!

[ SCREAMS ]

Man, he sure says "Bitch" a lot!

You can run,
but you can't hide, bitch!

Hold on, Morty.
Y-you know what?

He keeps saying we can
run but we can't hide.

I say we try hiding.

But that's the
opposite of what...

Yeah, well, since when are
we taking this guy's advice on anything?

Hey, you know what?

You got a really
good point there, Rick.

Like, if the truth was that we
could hide, it's not like

he'd be sharing that
information with us, you know?

I-I-I think it's a good idea,
Rick.

Worst-case scenario...

we're back to running.

Wow, you know what?

I mean, it looks like we could
have just hid this whole time.

Boy, Rick,
that was some good thinking.

Thanks, Morty.

Yeah, it's nice to be on the
same page every once in a while.

[ GRUNTS ] You can run...

but you can't hide!

[ YAWNS ]

RICK:
Oh, this is perfect, Morty. Look at that.

He's getting sleepy.

Just a little bit longer
before he calls it a day.

That's when we make our move.

[ MACHINES WHIRRING ]

Snuffles, we didn't
mean you any harm!

This is a huge misunderstanding.

Dad, he wants to
be called Snowball.

Well, I'm not calling him that.

That's ridiculous.

You're being very
aggressive, Jerry.

Perhaps tomorrow Dr. Scraps
will solve that problem

with a bit of surgery.

[ SCOFFS ]

You think you can control
me with a haircut?

Hi, honey. You're home early.
How was your day?

I don't want to talk about it!

Oh, of course. You never
want to talk about it.

Get off my back, bitch!

[ BABY CRIES ]

Out there.
Not in here.

Yeah, I know, I know.

I shouldn't take my anger
out on you or Scary Brandon.

I love you, Melissa.

I love you, too, Terry.

Morty, this is perfect.

After a little scary coitus,

they should be fast asleep
and then we'll incept him.

[ SMOOCHING ]

[ GROANING ]

Looks like Scary Terry's
having a nightmare.

Oh, boy, Rick.

I can only imagine what horrible
things must, you know...

[ DEVICE WHIRS ]

scare Scary Terry.

[ SCHOOL BELL RINGS ]

Oh, no!

I'm late to class, bitch!

Oh, no!

I'm not wearing any pants!

[ LAUGHTER ]

Ah, well, Mr. Terry, why don't
you tell the whole class

the proper wordplay to use when
one is chasing one's victim

through a pumpkin patch?

Oh... um...

"Bitch."

[ LAUGHTER ]

Oh, come on, Terry,
you can't think of a pun

involving pumpkins, bitch?

Hey, leave him alone!

Yeah, this is a
bunch of bullcrap.

Who cares what stupid pun you
make when you kill someone?

Why don't you let the poor guy
say whatever he wants?

Well, I never!

I-I see no reason to
stand here and take this.

You're putting too much pressure
on yourself, Scary Terry.

You know, I mean, y-you're
perfectly scary enough as it is.

Hey, yo, Scary T., don't even
trip about your pants ...dawg.

Here's a pair on us, fool.

Aww, bitch.

I don't know what to say.

You don't need to say anything.

We got you, dawg.

You're our boy, dawg.

Don't even trip.

Oh, hey, it's you guys!

[ BABY COOS ]

I haven't seen him
this relaxed in years.

If you guys ever need anything,
just say the word.

As a matter of fact, Terry,

there is something
you could help us with.

♪ "Q," "R,"
You won't get very far ♪

I always hated that song!

[ GASPS ]

[ DEVICE WHIRS ]

These halves don't
belong together, bitch!

[ GROANS ]

[ DEVICE WHIRS ]

Sex is sacred!

[ DEVICE WHIRS ]

This is because you don't give
Morty Smith good grades, bitch!

[ GASPS ]

Holy crap! God damn!

I know one thing for sure...
I'm giving Morty an "A" in math,

and that's my idea.

That is an original thought.

MORTY:
What the hell?

RICK: Out of the frying pan dot,
dot, dot, huh, Morty?

Oh, man, what's going on?

Well, it's possible that
your dog became self-aware

and made modifications on
the cognition amplifier,

then turned on Jerry, Beth,
and Summer after learning

about humanity's cruel
subjugation of his species,

but your guess is as
good as mine, Morty.

I can't believe how
mean Snuffles got just

because he's smart.

This is why I choose to get C's.
RICK: Psst, Beth, Jerry, Summer.

Dad!

Rick!

[ DEVICE ZAPS ]

Oh, thank God, Morty.

Oh, you're welcome.

All right,
let's get out of here.

If we hurry [GULPS] we can set
up camp in a sewer tunnel

or something before the dogs
completely take over.

Whoa, whoa, whoa.

We're not going anywhere.

This is my house.

I'm not abandoning it.

It's all over, Jerry.

The dogs are on a path
to total world domination.

But, hey, at least they know not
to piss on your carpet, right?

Wait a minute.

I have an idea.

[ CLEARS THROAT ]

Gentlemen,
a moment of your time.

See that?

I'm peeing all over
your special guns.

That means I own them.

Bad person. Bad.

Ooh, great plan, Jerry.

Bring the boy to me.

You were always kind to me,
Morty.

That's why I will leave
you with your testicles.

From now on, you will be my best
friend and live by my side.

Th-thanks, Snuffles.

Begin phase two.

NARRATOR:
Fighting continues as the dog

army captures the
Eastern seaboard.

It appears clear at this time
that the era of human

superiority has come
to a bitter end.

[ SCREAMS ]

Please! Please don't kill me!

[ MUFFLED SCREAMS ]

What's she saying, Bill?

I think she's saying,
"I love lasagna."

[ DOGS BARKING, HOWLING ]

Mmm.

Thank you, Fido.

Rick!

I thought you were dead!

No, no, no,
I was just playing dead.

Good news, though, Morty.

This whole thing's
gonna be over really soon.

What?

It's a dream, Morty.

We're in your dog's dream.

The night the dogs captured us,

after you cried and
crapped your pants, we...

we all went to sleep.

Then I used my dream inceptors
to put the two of us inside

Snuffles' dream.

But i-it's been
like a whole year!

It's been six hours.

Dreams move one one-hundredth
the speed of reality,

and dog time is
one-seventh human time.

So, you know, every day
here is like a minute.

It's like "Inception," Morty, so
if it's confusing and stupid,

then so is everyone's
favorite movie.

Aw, man.

I really liked this life.

Well, at least I didn't
really crap my pants.

No, no, that happened before
you went to sleep, Morty.

You're sleeping in
your crap right now.

Out of all the things that
happened to you,

that was the only real
thing that, you know,

is that you crapped your pants.

I mean, it's a mess out there.

I got some on my hands, Morty,
and then I got it on the dream

inceptor, and a piece
fell in my mouth.

Aw, man, geez!

Seriously?

Look, d-d-d-don't
worry about it, Morty.

Here, here take these, Morty.

Take these.

[ GULPS ]

Are these pills supposed
to wake me up, or something?

Close.

It's gonna make your
kidneys shut down.

What?!

It's necessary for the plan,
Morty.

Don't even trip, dawg.

[ MONITOR BEEPING ]

It's pretty bad,
Emperor Snowball.

We're gonna need to do another
operation.

Anything.

Anything for my precious Morty.

Sir, as your accountant,
I must advise you that these

medical expenses are putting you
in serious financial jeopardy.

You could lose your Kingdom.

To hell with my Kingdom,
Bean Counter.

I would trade it all for my
human's health and happiness.

Do you think they would
have done this for us?

We are not them!

We are not... them.

[ BARKS ]

[ GASPS ]

Assemble the troops.

I've made a decision.

Taking over the human's world
will lead to nothing but more heartbreak,

more cruelty.

Instead, we will go to a new
world and colonize it with a

society of intelligent dogs...

one that will not make the same
mistakes as humanity and one

where pet insurance
will be mandatory.

I'm gonna miss you, Snowball.

You can call me Snuffles, Morty,
and I'm going to miss you, too,

very much.

[ SNIFFLES ]

Jerry?

I'm sorry.

It's just like the end of
"Old Yeller."

Oh, Jerry.

You mean because it
had dogs in it.

Wow!

A whole world populated
by intelligent dogs.

I wonder what it'll
be like, Rick.

I think it will be great, Morty.

You know, it's g... i-i-i-i-it
could be developed in-into a

very satisfying project
for people of all ages.

I mean, I'd watch it, Morty,
for at least 1 1 minutes a pop.

You know, may-maybe they'll
do it board-driven.

You know, that's a real
comforting idea, Rick.

[ SIGHS ]

What do you know, Morty?

What do you know?

Hi, guys.

I'm your new teacher
for Scary class.

My name is Scary Mr. Johnson.

[ CHUCKLES ]

Uh, actually, you know what?

That's my dad's name,
so why don't you just

call me Scary Glenn, yeah?

[ STUDENTS GASP ]

So, anyway, I understand your
previous teacher was having you

work on Fundamentals of Fear.

Which is... what is that?

[ CHUCKLING ] You know?

So, uh, here...
here's what I say...

You can't learn anything until
you learn ...how to chill.

Oooh!

[ EXHALES DEEPLY ]

This is how you dream, bitch.

It's a good-a show!

﻿Previously,
on "Rick and Morty"...

Jerry, I had sex
with your wife.

Ohhh!

I did it!
I fixed portal travel!

Jack the Ripper,
at your service.

Cool!
This happened too?

I'm pregnant.

Honey,
she's just like you!

It's raining meatballs!
Okay, something is --

Jerry Smith died
doing what he loved --

getting stung by bees.

Off.
Off what?

Have some respect.
It's Dad's funeral.

I'm gonna name you
Jerry Jr.

Thanks for solving
that murder, guys.

Here's a skateboard.
Aw, thanks, Tony Hawk!

-Morty, say you'll marry me!
-What?
-What?

Just say yes!
Yes?

Okay...
Rick,
do you promise to --

I do, and for our honeymoon
let's go to a sealed chamber

lined with
ionized deuterium!
Why?

Because the charge acts
as a narrative decelerant.

Morty, none of this is real.

We're in a "previously on"
spiral. Clear your head.

After all
that's happened?!
No.

I-I'm innocent!
I didn't release those bees!

I love Jerry!

What'd I just say?
When?

Okay, great execution.
Let's go back to the chamber.

Now repeat after me, Morty --
"Next time on 'Rick and Morty.'"

Next time
on "Rick and Morty"?

No. Previously,
on "Rick and Morty"...

Ignore it, Morty.
"Next time on 'Rick and Morty.'"

It counteracts his toxins.

Next time on "Rick and Morty."
Whose toxins?

Hey, stop it!

Previous Leon!
Grab him!

Hold on tight, Morty!

We got to get through
the opening titles!

Opening titles of what?

-Whoa! We're in space!
-Let go of me! Ow!

Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!

What planet is this?

Cover your eyes
on this part.

Oh, my god,
it's a giant squirrel!

Why are we dressed
like old-timey people?

What the hell's going on?

Why is my dad in a suit?

-Best episode!
-Why am I butter?

Okay,
we're almost through.

Ohh!
Ohh!

Ow!

Ugh,
and we're back!

Stop!

Let go of me!
What just happened?

Why was there music?

Because of this conceptual
little piece of shit!

Grab his feet!

If we have opening titles,
d-does that mean that we're a --

Let your body purge
the meta-venom, Morty.

Don't succumb to his pointless
self-aware bullshit.

It's not pointless,
it's cool!

He's got a gun!
Eat lead, pussy!

No, no, no!

Fuck!

Oh!

Son of a...

Did he use a portal?
He wishes.

He wriggled back
to the meta layer

through a hole
in the fourth wall.

Put these on
and help me find it.

I-I don't like this, Rick.

Yeah, you shouldn't.
It's not a likable premise.

I mean it's funny
when I do a little nod
to the viewers, but...

What viewers?!
That's the right attitude,
Morty.

A few carefree verbal asides,
always by me.

None of this season-three
"Moonlighting" shit.

Okay, here it is.

You're going
to --to patch it?

No, he subverted
actual reality, Morty.

He needs to be
put down like a rabid dog.

Ow! Fuck!

Oh, yeah, no, you don't wanna
wear those over here.

Maybe he went
down that road?

No, no, no. If he took that,
he'd end up a hero.

Damn it, Rick.
I don't like this.

I-Is this whole place
just --

A bunch of
groan-inducing wordplay

for seven TV critics
that won't even enjoy it?

It's worse than you think,
Morty.

We're basting in
meta radiation right now.

Our credibility is
being permanently eroded.

Every second we spend here

is the equivalent
to 10 "Space Jam" cameos.

You should have thought
of that...previously!

Get him!

Ow! Ow!

Oh, no!

Bless me, Heavenly Father,
for you will save me.

Now I feel bad.
Let's just get out of here.

Because he prays?

You know Hitler was Catholic,
right?

I'm here, Leon.

Uhh...
Okay.

He apparently prays
very well.

Time for you two
to meet the Lord.

That's okay,
we're good.

Treat it
like a bear attack.

Just walk backwards
and make yourself look big.

I love a good refusal
of the call.

Hello, Rick.

Hello...
Amish Juggler?

His name is Story Lord.

Story...Lord?

Listen, trust me,
take Amish Juggler.

You can have it.
Story Lord.

Rick, h-he's the villain from
that toy train I bought you.

Very good, Morty.

The fictional versions of you
trapped me

in a Bible show for children,
but I used make-believe Christ

to transcend fiction
and enter meta-reality.

Now I'm the one
doing the trapping.

Leon was the bait.

Bait?!
Jesus?

Aaah!

Aah!

Don't ever...!
Dumb mother...!

You're using Jesus
to beat us up?

Have you seen
"South Park"?

Good call-out, Morty.

That's the kind of meta
I like,

the kind that keeps us
creatively accountable.

Oh, God. Not the Bane.
Not the Bane!

He Baned me, Morty.
Oh, Jesus Baned me.

Y-You can't beat me up.
I-I'm --I'm --I'm technically
a Christian child!

And I'm your worst nightmare.

I'm the Jesus
from every Jesus joke.

The one without a God.

Morty!
Take this and get out!

Thank you.

Looks like Story Lord's story
is about to become...

based on real events.

What do you want
with that?

I want what
any character wants.

Motivation!

What?
That's dumb.

So lazy!

Forward your notes
to my ass!

Wait, what?
He just left.

Kind of makes you want to be
our unlikely ally, huh?

Oh, I guess not.

Previously,
on Jesus Christ...

Hey, I'm Jesus.
I'm Mary.

That's my mom's name!
Stop.

Dude,
she's a hooker.

She's a better disciple
than you!

Ow! Aw!
Owww!

Oh, no.

I can't die.

I 'ave
a proposition for you.

I work alone.

If I suck-a your blood,
I'll be invincible!

I think!
You'll never know.

Aah!

Billionaire immortal
entrepreneur Jesus Christ

has placed all his money into
what he's calling

a "second chance at love."

Hang on, Mary!

The data!
So beautiful!

Make me normal,
witch.

Take it all!

Eat your pudding,
Mr. Christ.

What are
you smiling at?

Your name.

What's happening,
Rick?

Leon's venom makes you think
more and more of your life

is behind you as he feeds
on your released potential.

Leon,
y-you saved our lives!

Oh, not yet he hasn't.

Jeez, Rick!
So mean!

He's meta, Morty.
His life doesn't matter.

Yours does.
That's why we need to get back.

Well, this doesn't feel
like a citadel.

Uh, maybe it's cooler
on the inside.

This isn't what it looks like.

This is a very special diet
for successful writers.

Why do you look like
my character?

I am your character!
And you are going to improve me.

But you're Story Lord.
You're great.

Great isn't good enough!

I've killed Rick
and made myself real!

I'm better than
some shitty toy train.

Is this your office
or your apartment?

Why does it smell
like you sleep here?

You're my creator.
Why are you pathetic?

Because you failed!
And whose fault is that?

What the hell happened?

You want to know what happened?
Like, specifically?

Well, the Ricks wanted to do
a "Canterbury Tales"-type thing,

but none of them
have actually read

fucking "Canterbury Tales."

So then
they told me to make it like

the poker-game episode
of the Batman cartoon

where the bad guys
tell stories about Batman.

Then they kept telling me
it "needed something."

Yeah, no shit,
it needed something!

It needed to never be pitched!
I did my job!

Goomby, the Ice Queen,
the Tickets Please guy.

They just bailed on it!

The website didn't even
fucking work!

And it was a shitty URL
to begin with,

"Story-dash-train"?
Who uses a dash?

They set me up to fail.
They fucked me!

They fucked me and you're lucky
I haven't blown my brains out!

Right. Just give me a
motivation, you hacky fart.

Okay,
here's your motivation.

You're looking for motivation.
You want all the motivation.

That's lazy.
It got you this far.

Must be nice, by the way.

Wish I could afford to dress
like a bisexual acting coach

from the '70s.

My motivation...
is motivation.

Okay. Bye.

Oh, no, my bitter friend.
You're coming with me.

Yo! If you don't see me coming,
it's a bad fortress!

Where are we?

Headquarters of
the Self-Referential Six.

They're meta nerds
that found out

they could be
less bearable as a team.

They can help us?

No, but there's a prisoner here
that can.

Shh.
Don't tell them that.

Rick Sanchez.

I've been waiting for
this moment for years.

Oh, good.
Morty, this is Miss...Lead.

I should kill you
where you stand.

I brought you
Previous Leon.

You'll want to lock him up
in your detention center.

It's a trick!
He wants your prisoner!

You dick.
Liar!

Talk about a mislead.
Anti-meta field.

Fancy device.

I think I can recall
the time you built it.

Don't try it,
Flash Back!

You know, I-I'm excited about
the upcoming election.

This forcefield will be
impenetrable by meta-energy.

It runs
on hydrogen isotopes.

Hmmm.

It runs
on hydrogen isotopes.

A few barrels of petroleum
should dampen it.

Run, Morty!

Were those
not there before?

Guess there's been
a...Connie TinuityError.

These people are the worst!
I told you!
Way overpowered!

Look out, Rick!

Forget him.
He's a nameless guard.

That's Protago Nick.

His beam has the power to make
any character the protagonist.

D-Duck!

Oh, man, oh, man,
oh, man, oh, man.

Oh, man, oh, man,
oh, man, oh, man.

Gah!
What are you doing, Marvin?!

Not dying,
that's what I'm doing.

Oh, what's going on?
What happened?

I did it again, Katie.
I ran out on another job.

Well, if you didn't do that,
you wouldn't be my man.

I was almost tempted
to just let it go.

That's how much
I hate it here.

Smash cut!

Remember me, Rick?

Who's this guy, now?

I am Mr. Twist.

The fifth member of
the Self-Referential Six.

Who's the sixth?

That's the twist, Morty.
It's you.

What?
Ignore him, Morty.

The twist is
there's no sixth member

and he tells that
to everybody.

In any case,
you're ours now.

You can't free yourself without
a twist, and I control them.

You don't control every twist,
Mr. Twist.

I've got a twist for you.
Impossible!
What is it?

Aah!
Aha!
Nice try!

Like I didn't see
that coming.

Fuck me.

Great work, Morty!
I'm adapting!

Here's our ticket
out of here.

They got him in a cell
made out of sports

because it's
the opposite of story.

Do I want to ask
who he is?

His name is Brett Caan.

He has the power to make things
always have been other things.

I think
that's called retconning.

B-But his name's
Brett Caan?

I mean, Rhett's a name too.
His name could be Rhett Caan.

It is.
And always has been...now.

Whoa.
Careful, Morty.

Stay clear
of his retcon range.

Until he agrees
to help us.

Rick,
you've always trusted me.

Nice try.
Here's how it's gonna work.

You're gonna make it so Morty
and I never came here.

Once that's always been
the case,

I'll free you remotely
with this.

What is my purpose?

To wait until I tell you
to pull that lever.

You are
fucking kidding me.

If you don't free me
right now, Rick,

I can make
very, very bad things

always have been
the case for you.

Is that a threat,
you fuck?

Y-Y-You can rot in there.
Rick.

You know what, Rhett?
Forget what I said.

We've always been friends.

Good one.

Whoa, easy, Rhett.

Don't forget that coffee mug
I gave you.

You always were able to be
killed with coffee.

Aaah!

New plan. Run.
Again.

The twist being...

You were born without bones.

See ya never!

There's never been anything
outside this fortress.

God damn it!

And this fortress
has always been an orange!

Pluh!
Great plan, Rick!

Yeah, I'm not pushing back
on that, Morty,

I have royally
fucked us.

Ugh!
It hurts.

We've been past the fourth wall
too long.

We won't be real
much longer.

You killed us, Rick.

You just had to hate
meta storytelling.

In my defense, Morty,

I think you can agree
my hate was justified.

Ohh!

Least...earned...death...
ever...

Death is a threshold.

Ugh!
What --What happened?

You atoned.

Who --Who are you?

I'm Joseph Campbell.
Soup?

I almost considered not making
it because my name is Campbell,

but then I thought,
stay in the moment, Joe.

Follow your bliss.

How are you here?

R-Rhett Caan said
there was nothing.

Some things never change
about mythology.

There's always an old man
with soup.

Name one story
that doesn't have one.

Uh,
Jack and the Beanstalk.
"Basketball Diaries."

Every "Matrix."
Every movie ever.

Alright, I don't have to defend
myself to you people.

Where's my soup?

Previous Fuckin' Leon.

Why is that prick here?

No more a prick
than you, friend.

Meta characters
erode reality.

But all characters are meta,
Rick.

All of us are nourished
and consumed by chaos,

like newborns at the breast
of a meth addict

in a lifeboat filled with forks.

I know what you have
to do, Rick.

Scrub Campbell's
browser history?

Just trust
Previous Leon.

Could you
previously us a way home?

Uh, well,
I'll sure enjoy trying.

Yeah,
I bet you would.

Rick can't change,
Morty.

Change is what you might
call his Kryptonite.

Except instead
of being super,

he's, you know,
kind of a pussy.

Let's do it.

Previously, on Rick...

Get him off!
Get him off!

Oh, boy.

He almost killed you!

Okay, well, I feel bad,

I kind of pressured
you into trying that.

You called me a pussy.
I said I feel bad!

This is a map to a region rich
in narrative ore.

I wish you
the best of luck.

Faster, Morty!
I'd help, but I can't blister
my inventing hands.

How long will it take?
Years.

You can live
in my wood shed.

Just don't open the door
after dark.
Why not?

Get out here,
you Communist Jews!

Dude.
Maybe I'm not an alcoholic.

I know, right?
You fucking
"Back to the Future" rip-offs!

It's ready.

Rick, I should stay.

Why?
I'm pregnant.

What are you doing?
It wasn't him, Rick!
Then who?!

Me!
I never left.

But you had to think all this
happened to make that.

And I can get this
through the titles?

If you hang on tight.

What about my beard
and unborn child?

Let them go.
Thank you, Leon.

When you get home,
Rick,

do some
classic adventures.

Like season one --
I'm so sick of that
fucking note.

What the fuck
does it even mean?

Ohh!

Now, one last time.

What's my motivation?
Motivation.

This machine will siphon it
from everyone in the universe.

Perfect. Greenlit.
Launch it.

Oh, I think it's working!

Yes, I can feel it!

Something I did
is actually affecting someone!

I don't want to
work anymore.

I do, but only as an excuse
to not practice guitar.

Why don't we just write any
number down on the score sheet?

Oh, why even do that?

Wait, you have to
register?

Yes!
I can feel it!

I'm so motivated!

I want...a lot!

Story time's over.

Ha!
Hardly your decision.

Did you seriously double down on
motivation as your motivation?

It's a good idea!

There's no such thing!

There's joyful
and there's joyless,

and we've had our fill
of one.

Morty, make that sweaty writer
stop working

while I kill off
his character.

I have never been more driven
to destroy someone.

Yeah, well, I'm driven
to lower my blood sugar

but guess who's getting tacos
after he kicks your ass?

So you're jacked.
Who cares?

Cum gutters.

I don't like that phrase.
I don't take notes.

You can't beat me, Rick.

I have one million times
your motivation!

So do those guys with the
cellphone kiosks at the mall.

The hair is wrong.

Like you'd be picky
about licensing.

Actually, I would.
I happen to believe that --

You can do that?

You got to want it.

Come on, just stop.
I-I don't want to fight you.

Kid, I'm a writer that wrote
something successful.

So if you want me
to give it up,

you're gonna need a black belt
or a big pair of tits.

Yeah, well,
I don't have those.

In the mythical sense,
I have both.

Joseph Campbell?

Yeah, nice try.
He died in the '80s.

Only you can see and hear me,
Morty.

Just repeat
what I tell you.

Okay.

Sir, you're only proud of
your creation's success

because you want
to be creative,

but creation doesn't happen
through gimmicks,

technology, and distribution.

It doesn't even happen
through work.

Creativity is frankly adjacent
to mental illness and overlaps

with it substantially.

A lot of talented people
kill themselves

and all of them
are miserable.

The real gift
is to be ungifted,

and from what I saw
in your Green Arrow spec script,

that's the gift
you were given.

You couldn't
have seen that.

I'm Joseph Campbell.
I saw it.

The villain
was a placeholder.

I said I saw it, Jan.

I didn't say
I could get past page five.

Y-Your villains
aren't the problem.

The problem is, when you write,
you're a villain.

If you want to be a hero,
just stop.

You know what?
Maybe I will register.

Say it! Tell me
I'm the new Mr. Nimbus!

Oh, looks like your writer
took a hiatus.

Oh, fuck.

You're less motivated
to fight now,

so this is literally punching
down, but you've got it coming.

Please, let me live.

I promise to be cooler.

I'll be less inside baseball.
Maybe I change my name?

Ow!

You failed me.

No, I failed you.

All good things
must come to an end-

All bad things too, though,
so don't flatter yourself.

Jan, Joseph Campbell says

you have to be the one
to put him down.

Wait, wait, wait,
Joseph Campbell also says

you have to use this brand-new
limited edition Rick plush,

available only on
rick-plush.biz.

Supplies are limited.
Act now.

He did?

Shhh.

Jesus, that's the last time
I buy a toy from a Rick.

Ooh, the plushies
are obviously well made.

Thanks for getting us
back alive, Rick.

Well, I am a master
of both worlds, Morty.

Joseph Campbell told me
to stop writing.

Because it should be effortless.

And when it happens organically,
that's when it's meant to be.

You know, like, um, like me.

I'm a writer, here's a pencil.
Writers use pencils.

Okay, so, like, what if, like,
a pencil used me?

Like, um --okay!
Yeah!

Okay, so it's like
a magic pencil

that writes
the writer's life --

holy shit, it's a movie
about a writer!

I am back!

Yeah, I'm Tag-Man!

I-I-I-I live in the tag!

I-I-I am the tag!

I'm Tag-Man!

Tag --
Tag of the episode...man!

"Did you get any of that?"

When the --yeah, when
an episode's over, look out,

because, yaaaah,
here comes Tag-Man!

And I'm --I'm crazy!
Tag-Man!

Yeah!
I'm --I'mma tag your ass!

Tag that ass.

Tag-Ass-Man!

I'm an Ass-Man now!

I'm a --I'm a Tag-Man!

Here's what you get.
Here's your tag!

Yeah, you want some more?

You want --you want some more
tag you sick piece of shit?!

I'm --because I'm Tag-Man!

I miss my wife.

Too bad.
This is it!

Tag-Man, yeah!

Did you get any of that?

﻿PRINCIPAL:
Principal Vagina here...

Don't let the name fool you.
I'm very much in charge...

reminding you that tonight is
our annual Flu Season Dance.

I don't know how many times
I have to say this,

but if you have the flu,
stay home.

Hey.

The Flu Season Dance is about
awareness, not celebration.

[ SIGHS ]

You don't bring dead babies
to Passover.

Okay. Here we go.
H-Hey, Jessica. Uh...

What's up, Morty?
[ SNEEZES ]

What are you doing?

- Um...
- Wait, wait.

Were you about to talk...
to her?

Well... I mean, I was
thinking about it.

Dude, stay in your league.

Look at how hot she is.
You don't see me going...

to a bigger school
in a wealthier district

and hitting on their
prettiest girl.

Gee, thanks, Brad.

I throw balls far.

You want good words?

Date a languager.

JERRY:
Try not to worry about it, Morty.

You're a good kid,
and there's not a premium

on that right now,
but you'll be getting girls

sometime after Brad's
out of shape.

[ SIGHING ]
You're missing the point, Dad.

I don't want girls.
I want Jessica.

Ah, well, I remember
feeling that way

about a young lady named
"your mom,"

and that's not an urban diss.

Your mom was my Jessica.

I remember the first time
I saw her.

I thought...
- "I should get her pregnant,

and then she'll have
to marry me."

I beg your pardon, Rick...
inappropriate.

Sorry, please proceed
with your story

about banging my daughter
in high school.

I'm not sure you wanna take
romantic advice from this guy, Morty.

His marriage is hanging
from a thread.

My marriage is fine, thank you.

Jerry, it's your house...
whatever you say it is

is how it is... but I think
a blind man could see

that Beth is looking
for the door.

I barely have a reason to care,
and even I noticed.

Come on, Rick! Don't talk
about my parents like that.

Listen, Morty, I hate
to break it to you,

but what people call "love"

is just a chemical reaction that
compels animals to breed.

It hits hard, Morty,
then it slowly fades,

leaving you stranded
in a failing marriage.

I did it.
Your parents are gonna do it.

Break the cycle, Morty.

Rise above. Focus on science.

[ SLURPS ]

All right, well, I'm gonna go
get dressed for the dance.

Yeah, I'm just going to...
check on your mom.

[ DOG BARKING ]

Morty, hand me
that screwdriver, huh?

I'm almost finished making
my ionic defibulizer, Morty.

It's gonna be great.
- Hey, listen, Rick.

Y-Y-You know how you said
that, you know,

love is a chemical
and all that stuff from earlier?

Well, I was thinking, you know,

w-w... could you make some sort
of chemical thing happen

inside of Jessica's mind,
you know,

so where she falls in love
with me

and all that sort of thing?

You know, like, some sort
of love potion or something?

Morty, that's such
a poor use of my time.

It's beneath me.
Hand me the screwdriver.

You know what?
No, Rick!

I'm not gonna hand you
the screwdriver.

I-I'm not gonna hand you
anything ever again, Rick!

I'm always helping you with this
and that and the other thing.

W-W-W-W-W-What about me,
Rick?

W-W-W-W-Why can't you just
help me out once...

once... for once?

[ GROANS ]
You're growing up fast, Morty.

You're growing into a real big
thorn straight up into my ass.

Listen, this is called oxytocin.

I extracted it from a vole.

Do you know what a vole is,
Morty?

You know what a vole is?
It's a... it's a rodent

that mates for life, Morty.

This is the chemical released
in a mammal's brain, you know,

that makes it fall in love.

I just gotta... [BURPS]
combine it with your DNA.

Oh, well, okay.

A hair, Morty.
I need one of your hairs.

This isn't
"Game of Thrones."

Ow!

All right, Morty, whoever
you smear this stuff on

will fall in love with you,
and only you, forever.

Are you happy now, Morty?
- Heck, yeah!

Thank you, Grandpa Rick.

Hey, there's no...
dangers or anything,

or side effects, right?

W-W-W-What am I,
a hack?

Go nuts, Morty.
It's foolproof.

Eh, unless she has the flu.

Beth, do y-you still
love me?

Ugh, what kind
of question is that?

The "yes or no" kind?
[ LAUGHS NERVOUSLY ]

Jerry, do you want
homeless people to have homes?

Yes.

Are you gonna build them?

No.

Then what good was the "yes"?

Wait, i-is loving me the house
or the homeless people?

Loving you is work,
Jerry... hard work,

like building
a homeless shelter...

nobody wants to say
no to doing it,

but some people put the work in.

So, what do you say?
Do you see me working here?

Does this conversation seem
tedious to me?

Sort of.

Then I obviously
sort of love you, don't I?

[ CELLPHONE CHIMES ]

So stop asking, and maybe
I'll love you more.

Crap, they need me
at the horse hospital.

Puh! This late?

The racetrack
had a starlight derby.

There was a seven-horse
collision,

and Davin's there alone.

[ INDISTINCT SHOUTING ]

Morty, the principal and I
have discussed it,

a-a-and we're both insecure
enough to agree to a three-way!

I didn't realize
when I gave you that serum

that Jessica had the flu...
you know,

t-t-t-t-t-that might have been
valuable information for me!

What the hell is going on, Rick?

What does it look like?

T-T-T-The serum is
piggybacking on the virus.

It's gone airborne, Morty.

Oh, crap.
What are we gonna do, Rick?

It's gonna be fine,
Morty, relax.

I whipped up an antidote.

It's based on praying-mantis
DNA.

You know, praying mantises
are the exact opposite of voles.

I mean, they...
they mate once,

and then they, you know,
decapitate the partner.

I mean, it's a whole ritual.

It's really gruesome
and totally opposite.

There's no love at all.

I-I-I basically mixed this with
a more contagious flu virus.

It should neutralize
the whole thing, Morty.

It'll all be over very shortly.

[ INDISTINCT SHOUTING ]

Uh, by the way, Morty, I know
you didn't ask or anything,

but I'm not interested
in having sex with you.

I was thinking.

the opposite of voles?

complicated than that.

the trick, baby.

It's koala mixed
with rattlesnake, chimpanzee,

cactus, shark, golden retriever,

and just a smidge of dinosaur.

to normal humanity.

- What is it, Davin?

Just once, I'd like to know...

[ SNEEZES ]

w-w-what it was like
to give your son a bath.

What?!

What does Morty's skin
smell like?

How soft...
[ GRUNTS ]

How soft are his privates?

Let go of me, Davin!

[ GLASS SHATTERS ]

[ ROARS ]

Take me to Morty.

[ GRUNTS ]

You're not Morty.

No, I'm Mr. Crowbar,

and this is my friend,

who is also a crowbar.

That's... stupid.

[ GRUNTING ]

Yeah?

Well, look where being
smart got you.

Jerry! Thank God!

God?

God's turning people
into insect monsters, Beth.

I'm the one beating them
to death.

Thank me.
- Thank you, Jerry.

Thank you.

Take a good look down there,
Morty, and soak it in,

because, you know,
once I pull this lever,

it's all back to normal.

Just do it already.

Well, technically,
Morty, there's no rush.

I mean, you know,
o-once it's fixed, it's done.

It's fixed.
You know, we could...

we could just enjoy it
for a little bit.

I mean, I-I-I-look
at how crazy it is.

I mean, Morty,
w-w-when's the next time

you're gonna see
something like this?

I mean, soak it in, you know?

It's... it's pretty neat.
It's pretty interesting.

That's it, Rick!
I'm pulling the lever.

[ GRUNTS ]

W-What do we have here,
Morty?

Looks like I was right
and you were wrong, huh?

I-I-I-l-I bet you feel pretty
stupid right about now, huh?

I-I-I bet you feel like
the world's smallest man

that you were doubting me about
this whole thing, Morty.

Oh, Rick, something's not right.

[ SIGHS ] yeah, you.

You're not right... ever.

No, no!
Look, you idiot!

[ ALL SCREAMING ]

[ ALL SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]

[ ALL GROANING ]

[ ALL SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE ]

Bet you're loving this, Morty.

This must be the best day
of your life.

You get to be the mayor
of l-Told-You Town.

[ SLURPS ] You're welcome.

[ SLURPS ]

- Hold on.

[ BOTH MOANING ]

SUMMER:
Mom! Dad!

BOTH:
Summer!

[ SIGHS ]

Where's Morty?

I don't know.

Do you think Grandpa Rick had
something to do with this?

It's not fair to
assume that, Summer.

Oh, not fair?
Give me a break.

He is a selfish,
irresponsible ass,

and he left my mother.

A real man stands by his woman.

Boy, I really Cronenberged
the world up, didn't I?

We got a whole planet of
Cronenbergs

walking around
down there, Morty.

A-At least they're not in love
with you anymore, though.

That's a huge step
in the right direction.

Oh, my God!
It's a living nightmare!

How could you be
so irresponsible, Rick?

Me irresponsible?! You...
all I wanted you to do

was hand me
a screwdriver, Morty!

You're the one who wanted to
be... wanted me to buckle down

and make you up a...
roofie-juice serum

so you could roofie that
poor girl at your school.

I mean, g... w-w-w-w-w... w...
are you kidding me, Morty?

You're gonna try to take
the high road on this one?

Y-Y-Y-Y-You're a little
creep, Morty.

Y-You're a... you're...
you're...

you're just a little creepy...
creep person.

All right, fine. I should have
just listened to you

when you refused to make
the serum.

I'm willing to accept my part of
the blame for this, Rick.

But I'll tell you something...
you know what?

You gotta accept your part
of the blame!

I'm not the one
who fouled up the serum!

I'm not the one who...
who... who...

who haphazardly, you know,

mixed a bunch of nonsense
together

and created a bunch of
Cronenbergs!

You gotta fix this, Rick!
- All right, all right, Morty.

You know, w-w-w-we are
in a pretty deep hole, here,

but I do have one emergency
solution that I can use

that'll kind of put
everything back to normal,

relatively speaking.

Here, Morty, put this on
while I do

a little bit of scouting.

[ BIRDS CHIRPING ]

MORTY:
Wow, Rick, I gotta say...

you really pulled a rabbit out
of your hat this time.

I mean, l-I really thought
that the whole place

was gonna be messed up for good,

but here, you did it...
y-y-you... you...

you figured out that crazy
solution,

like you always do.

Whoo!
That's some great luck.

Come on, Morty. Luck had
nothing to do with it.

I'm great.
That's the real reason.

Now, Morty, what do you
say, buddy?

Will you hand me a screwdriver

so I can finish my ionic
dis... defibulizer?

Sure thing, Rick.
Here's a screwdriver.

All right, Morty.
Thank you very much.

We got one screw turn...
and two screw turns...

and...

All right, Morty, here we are.

Oh, my god, Rick!
Is that us?!

W-W-W-We're dead!
What is going on, Rick?

I'm freaking out!

Calm down, Morty!
Look at me! Calm down, Morty!

No, I can't deal with this!

Calm yourself, Morty.

I can't deal with this, Rick!

- Calm down, Morty.
- This can't be real!

- You gotta calm down, Morty.
- W-W-W-W-We're ripped apart!

Shut up and listen to me!

It's fine.
Everything is fine.

There's an infinite number
of realities, Morty,

and in a few dozen of those,

I got lucky and turned
everything back to normal.

I just had to find one
of those realities

in which we also happen to both
die around this time.

Now we can just slip
into the place

of our dead selves
in this reality

and everything will be fine.

We're not skipping a beat,
Morty.

Now, help me with these bodies.

This is insane.

Look, Morty, I'll grab myself,
you grab yourself, okay?

I mean, t-t-t-that seems
fair to me...

I mean, that seems like
a fair way to divvy it up.

Rick, what about
the reality we left behind?

What about the reality where
Hitler cured cancer, Morty?

The answer is don't
think about it.

It's not like we can do this
every week, anyways.

We get three or four more
of these, tops.

Now, pick up your dead self
and come on.

Haste makes waste.

I-I-I don't suppose you've
considered this detail,

but obviously, if I hadn't
screwed up as much as I did,

we'd be these guys right now,
so, again, you're welcome.

[ SIGHS ]

You ever wonder what happened
to Rick and Morty?

Sometimes.
But, I'm ashamed to admit,

now that they're gone,
I'm finally happy.

Here we are, Cronenberg Morty...

a reality where
everyone in the world

got genetically Cronenberged.

We'll fit right in,
Cronenberg Morty.

It'll be like we never even
left Cronenberg world.

Yeah, Cronenberg Rick,

but, you know, I'm gonna miss
Cronenberg world,

because everyone
was Cronenberged all along

like us from the beginning,
you know?

I mean, l-I wish we hadn't
genetically ruined

Cronenberg World
beyond repair like we did,

you know, and turned everyone
into regular, normal people

just walking around.

Don't you worry about
that sort of thing,

Cronenberg Morty.

Let's go make ourselves
at home, huh?

Did you get any of that?

It's a good-a show!

Rick, we did it!
We -- We got it!

Hurry up, Morty.
Get in!

Chachi!Fuck Chachi, Morty.

Did you get it?He helped me escape prison.

Did you get
the Ultimate Cube?

Oh, it's purple.

Y-You said
it was purple.

I said mine was.

I didn't know they all were.

And now we do,
thanks to Chichi.

Chachi.

So, uh,
w-w-when do I get it?

Get what, a hug?

Let's find a planet
with a garden hose first.

A dragon.
A dragon.

You asked me to cut class
and fight robots with you.

I said, "No."

You said, "Millions of lives
depend on it."

I said, "I'll do it
for a dragon."

You said, "Whatever."

I want my dragon.

You know who's into dragons,
Morty?

Nerds that refuse to admit
they're Christian.

I want my dragon.Let me give you
rocket shoes.

Let me give you
Wolverine claws.

Let me give you
a fucking rocket hat.

Just be sure to use it
with the rocket shoes,

or it'll rip your head off.

I want my dragon!
I want my dragon!

I want my dragon!

Oh.

Oh, crap.

Crap.

Dad, are you okay?

Your ship
crashed in Malta.

I'm okay.

Oh, thank God.

Dad, did you promise
Morty a dragon?

Fuuuuuuu--

Ugh!

Bleed here and here.

I'm not co-bleeding.

Under authority
of our treaty

'twixt the realms
of dragon and man...

Oh, my God,
it's my first gay wedding.

Summer!

...I hereby bind
this noble serpent and rider

at the soul.

Here's your tome of
dragon spells and lore.

That'll have everything
you need.

Enjoy your dragon.

Okay, dragon,
here's the house rules.

My name is Balthromaw,

breaker of sky,
slayer of mountain.

Rule one -- You are now scooper
of your own poops,

or I will take you down like
the black-light poster you are.

I don't got any more rules.
That's it.

I'm guessing you'd rather not
be tagged in this.

Okay, I'll bite.

What's with
the talking cat?

It's a dragon,
dip knob.

I know that's a dragon.

I'm talking about
the talking cat in my bedroom.

Jerry, why would I give Morty
a talking dragon

and you a talking cat
at the same time?

Those concepts bump.

If you're talking to a cat,
it's an abnormal event

unrelated to me like
when you went to Pluto

or fucked my daughter.

Okay, there's really no need
to get savage.

So?

Eh, he says he has nothing
to do with your talking.

- Told you.
- So then why are you talking?

Why should that matter?Why should it not matter?

How do I know I'm not
hallucinating?

Rick said this is
an abnormal event.

Do you always need Rick
to tell you what's going on?

Maybe it's time you stopped
asking questions

and started having fun.

Oh.

Wow, okay.

So, what do you want?

I want you to take us
to the airport

and get us two
first-class tickets to Florida.

Why, I --
I can do that.

Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

Oh, this is so cool!

I await
your next command.

Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Nobody is commanding anybody.

I love soaring through the sky
with you as equals.

W-What do you
want to do?

I want to enter my lair
and sleep upon my hoard

until the Age of Man
expires.

Okay.

Split the diff?

20-minute nap
and soar through the sky?

Ugh.

As you command.

Okay, see you soon.

T-This is fun.

Yeah, right.

What's this show called,
"Ass"?

Yeah, it's like "Bones,"
but they solve ass crimes.

This ass is a clue.

Are these two
gonna hook up?

No, and only the lame fans
want that.

Don't tell me
how to enjoy things.

Go to her ass.That's Brenner.

Go to Brenner Ass.

Honeymoon over
already?

What's that
supposed to mean?

Admit it, Morty.
Dragons suck.

Why don't you admit you don't
anyone else to be happy

because
you're a sad old fart?

How do you
saddle a fart?

Holy shit.
Look!

- I love you, Ass.
- I love you, Brenner.

No.
Shh.

Ah!
Oh!

And that's the end of the
"Morty Gets a Dragon" episode.

Are you gonna
slay it?

First off,
I always slay it, queen.

Secondly, yes.Should I pause "Ass"?

Nah, it's kind of boring
now that they're together.

Hey, fuckface.

Will you shut the fuck up
or at least roll over?

Oh, no, it burns.

Oh, my God.
Oh, the fire of -- of it all.

Ah, if only I had
prepared better

for this terrifying battle
by remembering

the only thing dragons
are known for.

Careful you don't
get heartburn.

I made that android
with a lot of C4.

Oh, I'm sorry.
I imbued it with

a remote-controlled
explode-y potion.

You have bested me.

I am at your service.

Good to be on
the same parchment.

Now, I'm gonna tell
my grandson you ran off

with a low-flying while you pack up your --

Wait, is this --
Why do you have an original

Ecto Cooler
juice box from 1989?

I hoard that which
your kind covets.

Give you 20 bucks for it. Nice try.

What the hell else
are you hoarding down here?

Cha-ching.
"Small Soldiers" Spin Pops?

Don't open that.I'm not an idiot.

Hey, why do you have Future's
self-titled album on vinyl?

Look closer.

Oh, shit.
He signed it.

Closer.

He signed it in molly
and Percocet?

I could spend all night
down here.

Do you indulge
in volcanic fumes?

Is it gonna
fuck up my brain?

No.
I'll do it anyway.

Hoo, those were not
cheap tickets,

but, um,
I'm down to clown.

Uh, w-w-w-why can you talk
again, uh?

It's not important,
Jerry.

Okay,
but why Florida?

Because they don't
ask questions.

They play volleyball,
they party, and they have fun.

Right, right.

You can do this,
Jerry.

I can do this.

I can do this.

Ugh!

Oh, yeah.

Hey, Jerry, after this game,

come to my yacht
and bring your cat.

You got it, Jipe.

I got to admit,
you were right.

I've got to tell you
something, Jerry.

This is the happiest I've ever
been in my entire life.

Oh, gross!
Who shit in the sand?

Someone took a small shit
in the sand

and buried it with, like,
two little kicks

and just left it here
like a land mine.

Why and who?

It was him.

Morty, the moral of this story
is bros before dragons.

You know what
I'm talking about?

Yeah, if he dies while
you're soul bonded, you die too.

Morty, the moral of this story
is bros rescue dragons.

Balthromaw, by soul bonding
with multiple riders,

you have violated the treaty
between dragon and mankind.

The Dragonarchy sentences you
to hang by the neck until dead.

On the count of three.

One Dragonarchy,

two Dragonarchy,

21/2--
I just wanted to make sure --

three!

Grandpa Rick, what's wrong?

Oh, God. The wizard must have
hung Balthromaw!

Well, fuck it.
Can we go back then?

W-Well, no, no.
It takes, like, 78 years

to hang a dragon
to death, so...

Aw, man.
It's so annoying.

a really big vitamin

with no water?

and it kind of gets,

and activate this golem.

Good luck with that.

Let's go.

or, like,

working out for you,

I could get used
to this magic stuff.

There's Balthromaw.

Check this shit out.

Oh, yeah, yeah.
Don't even look.

Don't even bother looking.

Just fucking let magic
guide your arrow.

Summer, what the hell
are you doing?

Take this seriously.Shut the fuck up, Morty.

Stop trying to pretend like
magic involves skill or thought.

Summer, make it look like it's
coming out of your butthole.

Ah!

Oh, fuck,

That's great, not being asked
why I can talk.

I'm a talking cat, but
"Who cares why?" is my point.

Well, nice talking to you
for no reason.

Jorge,
that was a good one,

but do you know what
a peanut butter gargoyle is?

Nah, what's that?

Dude, it's when you
take the chick,

put her feet on a cathedral --Sorry to interrupt, guys.

Just want to clarify,
are these real sex positions?

Because if they are,

how are they gratifying
to the male at all?

And if the goal is
to make something up,

why not make up
something...funnier?

I'm asking too many questions,
aren't I?

How ironic.

Get out of Florida,
you overthinking cat.

Why don't you go overthink shit
up north in Georgia?

Hate that cat.

You got any money
for a cab?

Why ask questions?

Why not just have fun?

I deserve that.

Attention, citizens of Draygon,

a slut dragon has escaped.

Anyone caught harboring it
is also a slut.

That's how it goes.Ow, my eye.

It pains me that
you can feel my pain.

Yeah, how about
you suck your dick,

which is also
somehow my dick?

Aw, why can't couples that start
out cheating ever end up happy?

M-Maybe I can find
that wizard's portal spell

in here and g-get us home.

How about finding the spell
that unbinds me

from your fucking dragon?

No spells can do that.

Only the wizard
can unbind soul bonds.

Uh, who the fuck are you?

Who are we?
Who the fuck are you, bitch?

Debrah, stop.
We are the slut dragons.

We live in these slut caves
where we fuck,

suck, and eat butt, and
we kindly ask that you leave.

If the wizard knows we are here,
he will imprison us.

Yeah!
We like it down here

'cause we can fuck
woolly mammoths. Get out!

Get the fuck out of here,
Michael!Shut up, Michael!

You're the only one
that fucks that thing.

Get the fuck out of here.

Well, at least
I'm not into shit play.

- Fuck you!
- Hey, wait!

Everybody stop, stop!

Listen,
this is all my fault.

I started all this when
I tried to control Balthromaw,

and that was fucked up.

Nobody should control anyone,

especially that guy up there.

And, um, you can eat butt
if you want, I guess.

I, uh --I got this, Morty.

Okay, listen up,
slut dragons!

Wouldn't you rather
be sluts up there,

have a fuck world
instead of a fuck cave?

What's wrong with you?

This man with a ponytail
makes a valid point.

All dragons are sluts deep down,
even the ones up above,

but we would have to kill
the wizard to be free.

He is too powerful.

There is a way
to kill the wizard.

Whoa.
Who's this mysterious character?

Shadow Jacker,
you haven't come out

of your masturbation cave
in eons.

It's high time I emerge
from my cum cocoon.

I grow tired of eavesdropping
and masturbating

to the sounds
you all make.

Jesus Christ.
All right.

C-Could use
a little more mystery.

Oh, oh, just now
seeing the staff.

We've never had enough sluts
to defeat the wizard.

Now, with the four fresh,
wet sluts that

just landed on our doorstep,
we finally have a chance.

So killing the wizard
will break my soul bond.

Yes, it solves
all of our problems.

We must begin
a 10-slut soul orgy...

Wait, wait, what?

...and become the all-slut
slut phoenix dragon, Slut.

Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Hold on. Hold on.

There's got to be
something else in here.

There's got to be another way.
Just give me a second.

I haven't read
all this yet.

Maybe don't tell your parents
we did this?

Oh, oh, no.
Oh -- Wait, please, no!

Ice spell!
Ice spell!

Oh, God!

That just made it
last longer.

Ah, it burns longer!

Ah, I could have died fast!

Thank you, strangers.

Well, it's your world now.
Have fun with empowerment.

It seems to make everyone
that gets it really happy.

All right, guys.
I'll use this to open a portal.

Uh, open a portal
to Earth.

Let's get the hell
out of here fast.

God, look at
this piece of shit.

Why is there writing on it?
Who writes on a portal?

Should've taken me up on those
Wolverine claws instead, Morty.

Wait,
why did the dragon come?

I was thinking
we could hang out?

Oh, yeah.
Whoa, Jesus.

Your dad's been texting me
this whole time?

Uh, he's at an airport
with a cat.

Okay, that --
that sounds -- Wow.

You know,
I better check on him.

Big season finale right there,
you know?

Better, uh --
Better go right now.

Also, I told you not
to get a dragon, Morty.

This is your fault.
Fuck you, worst adventure ever.

Worst adventure ever.

Yeah, uh, I guess you better be
on your way too, Balthromaw.

Well, I've been thinking.

What you said back there in the
cave really resonated with me.

Maybe we could
try again?

Look, to be honest,
I'm kind of grossed out

with the sexual nature
of how everything unfolded.

I didn't know
how sexual dragons were.

I kind of just wanted to do
some D&D stuff, you know?

And have a soul orgy
with your sister and grandpa

and every dragon
we could find, yeah?

No, look,
can you please just go?

I-I-I really
want to shower.

Maybe a quick soul bone
before I go.

I-I-I-I'm good.

I think
I just need to be alone

and sort of
un-- unpack all this.

What about your grandpa?

Would he want to?
I can wait.

No,
I think you better go.

I-I'm gonna take
that shower.

If it's just warm liquid you
want trickled over your body,

I could maybe --
No, no, look.

I just want to be clean!

I-I-I feel dirty after
everything that's happened.

How about
a quick hand bond?

I like doing it.You're embarrassing yourself.

I-I-I'm closing the door.

Fucking soul teasers.

This is a cool car.
I like having fun.

That's what I'm talking about.
Keep it moving.

Don't ask why I can talk.

Mm, mm, mm.
Uh-huh.

For sure. For sure.

Where are we going?

Quantum radiator might need
some nanowater.

We --
We can stretch our legs.

So, uh,
why can you talk?

What is this?

I need you in one spot
for a clean mind scan.

Mind scan?
Look, you're overthinking it.

The point of a talking cat
is to have fun.

I find the insinuation that
I can't ask questions

andhave fun
condescending.

Y-You find it
condescending, Jerry?Yes.

- All right. I'm from outer space. Happy?
- No.

Exactly, because no answer
would be satisfying.

Because it's a lie.

Let's see the truth.

What in the...

Oh, son of a bitch.

Jerry, don't.I want to see.

No, you do not.

No, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no!

At least now maybe --

Get the hell out of here!

But I've got
nowhere to go.

Get out!
Get out!

Get out!

He was in my home where
I keep photos of my parents.

Jerry, I have a device.

I-It can make us forget.

No, I don't think we should
forget,

not this.

Someone
has to remember.

Someone will.

Did we crash?

Where's the cat?

He, uh, ran away.

Did you scan his brain?Yeah.

Did you find out
why he can talk?

He's from outer space.

Outer space?

That little --

Of course, total mind fuck.

Now, that's what I call
draggin'.

What?
It's a joke.

You're a dragon
draggin' your stuff.

I understand.

So, how you doing?

I grow weary
of you humans.

How about 50 bucks?
You weary of 50 bucks?

I'm trying to
cheat on my wife.

I'm looking for a little magic,
a little fantasy.

You could use some help.
Let's help each other, huh?

50 bucks.

Nice.

Is there a reason
you can speak?

Yeah,
and I'm ashamed of it.

Then speak of it
no more.

Do you wish to eat,
maybe bond a little?

Yeah, I could bond.

How long does it take you
to fly to Florida?

Did you get any of that?

﻿Ohh!

Summer, next time we're hiding
in a Colorkian echo nest,

can you do me a favor
and turn your ringer off?

It's called "carpe diem,"
Morty.

- Look it up.
- You look it up!

Y-Y-You don't even -- You don't
even know what it means!

That's because
losers look stuff up

while the rest of us
are carpin' all them diems.

Listen to your sister, Morty.

To live is to risk it all.

Otherwise,
you're just an inert chunk

of randomly assembled molecules

drifting wherever
the universe blows you.

Oh, I'm sorry.
Jerry, I didn't see you there.

H-How much of that did you hear?

All of it.
You were looking right at me.

[SIGHS] I just wanted
to say goodbye to the kids.

Cool.
Just stay in the driveway.

The killbots are live, and
I took you off the white list.

W-We'll see you every other
weekend, though, right?

Absolutely, Morty.

A-And your Mom's lawyer says

if I can get enough
in the settlement,

he can help me
sue for full custody.

Th-That'll be nice.

- Uh, Summer, Dad's leaving.
- Bye,Dad.

Rick, didn't you say
you needed my help

on an adventure immediately
somewhere else --

I don't care --
even if it might kill us?

I did not, but if you're
really that alienated,

I'm as willing to exploit it
as the next guy, church, army,

or Olympic gymnastics trainer.

I'm ready when you are.

Bitch, I was ready yest--

Bye, sweetie.

Well, I-l better...

Sure.
Sounds important.

If you're looking for our kids,

your father did a-a portal,
uh...

Okay.

[BIRDS CHIRPING]

[WIND WHISTLING]

[WIND CHIMES TINKLING]

What?

Hello?

[DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYS]

[WHOOPING]

[GUNSHOTS]

Morty, shoot the Mohawk guy!

- They all have Mohawks!
- High fade,

chartreuse with cyan highlights,
layered on top.

Shoot him!

[GUNSHOT]

Ah!

Light them up.

Ahh!

Fuck!
Get in the game, Morty!

Give me your flask!

RICK: Holy shit!
Summer for the win!

SUMMER:
I fucking love

post-apocalyptic versions
of Earth!

[MONITOR BEEPING]

Here we go!

Isotope 322.

This stuffs so powerful, Morty,

it makes Isotope look like Isotope 317.

Uh-huh, yeah.
Is it powerful enough

to keep those guys
from murdering us?

- Summer!
- Hold on.

I want to try something.

Rick, can we not leave
without my sister?

Ugh. You have infinite sisters,
Morty.

I mean, n-not that I want
to spend the rest of my day

looking for another one.

"Sum-sum," let's go!

Grandpa's concern for
your safety is fleeting!

Your blood will be my lotion.

Whoa. That was cool.

[GROANING]

Kill me, please.

Okay, but not because
you told me to.

- Summer!
- Okay. Getting darker.

Jesus Christ.
Summer!

Aw, come on.

Hands and little
shoulder-mounted dudes

where I can see them.

I am Hemorrhage.

You have removed weak blood
from us and made us stronger.

We can combine our strength
and feast on the weak together.

Wh-Wh-What in the hell
are you saying?

They don't have to keep trying
to kill us if we join them.

- They're basically pussies.
- What is your deal lately?

All right, let's get sloppy.

-[ POWER SURGES]
- Oh, whoa.

Uh, uh, what's, uh --

What's that little bauble
you got back there?

Th-Th-That's interesting.

That is our glowing rock.

We carry it with us
for desecration,

to remind us there are no gods.

[MONITOR BEEPING]

Kids, weird pitch.
Let's have this be our new life.

Let's be post-apocalyptic
scavengers!

- Okay.
- What?

[ROCK MUSIC PLAYS]

[ INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS]

Grandpa,
some of the Death Stalkers

are going to
what used to be Seattle

to hunt what used to be people.

- I'm going.
- Sounds good. Stay hydrated.

Listen, Rick, Summer's been
acting pretty crazy lately.

You know, I mean, I-l think
the divorce is affecting her.

And, you know,
I don't think this is

a great place
for her to be right now.

Oh, get off your high horse,
Professor Ski Lodge.

This world may be
rough around the edges,

but it's got its charms.

WAR CHEF:
Bicep or quadricep?

Uh [CLEARS THROAT] bicep.

[FLESH SIZZLES]

Seriously, Rick?

Is it really easier
to eat human flesh

than to just tell me
why we're still here?

No.
Okay, I'll level with you.

You see that green rock, Morty?

It's about 20 pounds
of the stuff

I was getting all hard
for a flake of.

Isotope 322.

Well, having
a 20-pound boulder of it

is better than having a flake.

I can explain the math
to you later, but --

Summer just ran off
with strangers

that have "Death" in their name,

and the rest of their name
was "Stalkers."

Huh, could be
therapeutic for her.

She has been acting pretty crazy
lately, Morty.

I mean, her parents are
going through a divorce --

God damn it, Rick,
that's what I -- Fine.

Just grab the stupid thing
while I grab her,

and let's get the "F"
out of

No, no, no. Morty, there's
too much heat on the bogey.

I need you to distract the camp.

"Distract"?
They eat each other.

What -- What do you want me
to do to get their attention,

Put on a puppet show?

Right idea, wrong genre, Morty.

The equivalent here would be...

Hey, you guys ever use
that Thunderdome,

or do you just put it up
for decoration?

Uh, you mean the Blood Dome?

Save it for the Semantics Dome,
E.B. White.

- Ohh, burn!
-[ FINGERS SNAP]

The important question is,

who wants to take a poke
at my man Spine Eater here?

[ALL CHEERING]

I guess I'll see your asses
in that dome!

Rick, what the hell, man?

Wh-What are you,
out of your mind?

Morty, relax.
You're gonna be a ringer.

Come here.

This device extracts and
redistributes muscle memory.

I'm giving your body a 10-year
course in wasteland combat

-one limb at a time.
- Ow!

I'm working with
a mixed bag here,

so you may not have perfect
coordination, Morty -- Ugh!

- Hey!
-|-| didn't do that!

Okay, this is exciting.

We're making some discoveries
about muscle memory.

Ooh! Help! Help!

- Oh, sweet, man!
-[ INDISTINCT SHOUTING]

And so it begins, my pretties!

Oh, God! Stop! Stop!
This is horrible!

Just stick and mo[BELCHES]ve,
Morty!

Wear him out!

[SNARLING]

How come you guys dress like

you're in a theme-park
stunt show,

but these guys wear khakis
and hockey jerseys?

After the boom-boom,
some adapted to the new truth,

and some chose to huddle
near the boomy holes,

clinging to the lie
of the before-fore times.

The raidy-rays rotted them away,
leaving only their love

for the vert-vert-isements
on billyboards.

Jesus Christ.

Did the boomy-booms blow up
all your wordy-word books?

You mean dictionaries?

[GROANING, SNARLING]

I think I was a child
before the boom-booms.

I think I looked like this.

Want to piss on him?

Get out of my head.

ELI:
Ha ha! Whoo!

Unbelievable!

A new champ!

Okay, no more!

And he wants more!

No,l don't

Someone make this stop!

Mister, please get out of here,
or you're gonna die!

I have nothing to do with this!

Morty.

Why would you
want this to happen?

All you had to do was go away!

Stop standing in the driveway
talking about custody!

And either tell her
you want to stay married

or get on with your life,
but whatever you do,

stop being a baby
and act like a man!

[ SPECTATORS CHEERING ]

[PANTING]

Thank you.

Morty, that was amazing!

This is my brother!

Not that family means anything!

This family does.

All right.
Good job, champ.

Um, can I talk to you kids
for a second over yonder?

Rick, I-I-I think I'm breaking
through to something here.

C-Can we not leave just yet?

- Leave?
- I'm not leaving.

There is no "leave."

We are united,
or we are enemies.

Oh, big guy, no.
Nobody's leaving.

Don't be stupid.

We love being united.

We love the radiation,
the trichinosis.

We're in it for life,

which I assume is
around 20 years, average.

I just need a quick aside
with my grandkids,

about 40 yards from anyone else.

Hey, the Green Rock is gone!

- Oh, no!
- Uh, I know.

Why don't we all split up and
look for it in groups of three?

Kids?

Ohh.

We'll be right back.

Grandpa, you're being stupid!

Just surrender, and our friends
will give you mercy!

Kiss my ass, Summer!

Your friends have no mercy!
They're lame!

Death Stalkers,
bring me his flesh leather!

[SQUEALS]

Sorry, but can we not kill him?

C-Can we just take him prisoner?

When did I lose control here?

Listen to me --
Both of you kids

need to get out
of this environment

so we can properly deal with
your parents' divorce!

Alternatively,
I have a freaking portal gun,

and I can leave the two of you
here forever!

Why does it have to be
such a dramatic choice?

Can't we arrange a thing
where we spend weekends here

or -- or visit home
to do laundry?

All right, you know what?
Fuck it!

My body is chrome!

My blood is gasoline!

Nope. Regular blood.

- Dad?
- Hi, sweetie.

- Where are the kids?
- Oh, th-they aren't with you?

I thought they were with you.

Oh, y-you know what?
Uh, I just remembered.

They're out doing something

completely ordinary
and kid-related.

- Don't panic.
- Not panicked at all. Just --

Oh, God, what's the divorce
doing to the kids?

What's it doing to me?
Did I make a mistake?

Not a mistake, no!

I mean, not that
I have a horse in this race,

but this divorce decision,
listen -- mwah! --

good for you,
good for the kids.

I mean, honestly, I think
that they're flourishing.

I mean, you'll see, when --
when -- when you see them,

that -- that they're
totally flourishing.

[CHEERING ]

BOOyah!
FUCK you, pal!

Who else wants some?

Who wants to be
my pussy of a dad today?

Hey, what's --
what's wrong, man?

You're not getting weak on me,
are you?

[SPECTATORS MURMURING]

What?

Wait a minute.

[WOMAN SCREAMS]

[INDISTINCT SHOUTING]

[SCREAMING]

What's the matter,
you piece of crap?

Haven't you ever watched your
family burn to death before?

[LAUGHS EVILLY]

Now I'm gonna whip you.
Huh!

It can't be.
It can't be!

- I was just following orders!
- Whoa, whoa!

- I was just following orders!
- Aah!

I'll tell you
where my boss lives!

He's in the castle!
He's in the castle!

[SCREAMING]

This isn't over, is it?

That means, no, it isn't over,

or you disapprove
of the question?

Uh, m-make a fist
if this isn't over.

This isn't over.

[GRUNTS]

Hey, sorry my grandpa stole
your god and ruined your car.

We don't apologize,
and we have no god.

But this cracked driveshaft
brings me great pain.

There is no deeper bond

than the one between
a Death Stalker and his car.

What about the weird guys
on leashes, then?

They're more like...interns.

Cool, cool.

[HELMET CLANGS]

Sorry.

It's okay.

Can l...see?

No one has seen my true face
and lived.

Well, I'm not afraid to die,

and I don't care
what you look like.

[ GASPS ]

Oh.

Hmm?

I just...

I didn't expect you
to have a mustache.

- You hate it.
- No. I like it.

I guess --
How do I explain this?

A metal bucket is, on a certain
level, a kind of "mustache,"

in that it's a specific
facial accessory.

So, it's kind of like --

Do you guys have the phrase
"hat on a hat"?

- I can shave it.
- No. I like it.

And obviously what I like
shouldn't matter.

It's you.

Yeah, yeah, I know,
a-and nothing does matter.

Obviously, I know that.
I'm not weak.

I'm just thinking, "Well,
why not get rid of this?"

You just kill everyone
that sees it, and it's --

and it's hot under here,
wh-which, by the way,

is why I shave the beard part.

So, right there, I'm making
a decision based on vanity,

which is what
I was trying to avoid

with the whole bucket
over the head

because who am I
and why am I grooming myself?

Why don't I just wear a tie,
right?

I mean, it's like that guy
you killed when I met you,

with the burnt dolls
on his body.

I hated that guy, because,
why -- why are you doing that?

And how can you not see
how fake that is?

And the whole time,
I'm the same thing.

I'm just a fake mess,
and there's no escaping it

-because --
- Mmm.

[BOTH MOANING]

Hey, I'm doing a coffee run --
Never mind.

[METAL SQUEAKING]

-[ POWER SURGES]
- I am Summer.

Summer, state your deal.

My deal is that I am,
like, totally fine.

<i>Marty'?</i>

Aw, geez, I'm so down with
my parents' divorce, dawg.

Like, don't even trip,
like, in a healthy way.

All right.
It's dinnertime.

[ SLURPS ]
Thanks, everybody,

for sitting down
for a real dinner.

TOGETHER:
No problem.

Its benefits are totally,
like, less about the food

than the emotional nourishment.

Uh, okay, weirdo.

[CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY]
Yeah, dial it back, Summer...

by 15% and increase
dynamic movement by 3%.

- Am I right?
- How's school, Morty?

I like school and stuff,
kind of.

And I'm getting better grades
than when you and Dad were --

quote mode --
"staying together for the kids."

End quote mode.

"Quote mode."
I like that.

You millennials.

Are you guys millennials,
or are they like 40 now?

All I know is, totally,
you look great.

Aw, geez, Mom, you look
all kind of great and stuff.

- It's crazy.
- So happy.

So happy.
Happy family, man.

We got this family in the bag.

Oh.
[CRIES]

Oh, sweetie, d-don't.
Listen. Don't --

I don't know why I'm crying.
It's not...

Well, try...crying 15% less?

Mom, emotions are human.

You're not, like, a computer
inside a mechanical doll.

Yeah. Geez, Mom.

Your feelings are
not only forgivable,

they are the very
meaning of life

that only pre-silicon,
carbon-based entities

can ever grasp.

- I have to call Jerry.
- You do?!

What the fuck
is wrong with you two?

The point of automation
is to reduce cost and labor.

Your feelings are
coming from a...

Tell it to my bread
in the morning.

You just became
my backup toaster.

[CHUCKLES ] Aw, geez,
my sister died in the spaghetti.

[ALL GRUNTING]

Graze my genitals again,
Taint Washer,

and you'll be shipped
to the wasteland.

And as for you,
Genital Washer --

Aah!
Oh!

[GRUNTING]

Oh, God.
Look, whoever you are,

you should know that killing me
won't change a thing.

L-Look, man, I'm just along
for the ride on this one.

You know, y-y-y-y-you're
preaching to the choir here.

Please.
Slavery was a family business.

I didn't ask to be born into it.

If anything,
I'm the victim here.

Uh, "Armathy,"
can I steal you for a second?

E-E-Excuse us, sir.

So, this is it, isn't it?

This is the guy?

So, does that mean
you'll be going away?

Like, does it work like a ghost?

Like, is -- is this
your unfinished business?

Wh-What if we...didn't do it?

What if we just went back
to the Blood Dome

and just kept taking our baggage
out on unrelated people?

I mean, w-we could
do that forever.

I mean, I-l know
it's less healthy,

but w-w-we'd be together and...

I mean, I-l know
what I'd vote for,

if you're feeling out the room.

[SIGHS]
You're right.

We both got to
see our stuff through.

I got to deal with
my parents' divorce,

and you got to, you know,
do what you got to do.

I love you.

Aw, fuck.

[GASPING ]

[GLASS CLINKING]

- Rick?
- Sorry, sorry.

<i>L-|-l</i> can wait
for this to wrap up.

Don't let me distract you.

Yeah, well, too late.
Just tell me what you want.

I want you and your sister
to come home.

Oh, but don't -- don't you have

infinite versions
of me and my sister?

You don't have to kick me
while I'm down, Morty.

Look, there's no replacing
either of you

without an amount of work
that would

ultimately defeat the purpose.

Maybe the lesson
we've learned is that,

whether
it's our parents' marriage,

a glowing green rock,
or an awesome, giant arm,

sooner or later,
we got to let it go.

I don't know if that applies

to the throats
of murder victims, Morty.

Shit!
Wh-Wh-Wh-What do I --

RICK: Well, the longer you wait,
Morty,

the more it's gonna feel like
committing a whole murder.

I think your arm
just called it too early

because it wasn't
the arm of a paramedic.

Here.

It's the least I can do.
I-I-I-I owe you this much.

See, Morty?
Now we're both accountable.

[DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING]

The reason I wanted this
is because it can do this.

This is a really special thing.

I mean, you could use it
to power all your vehicles.

You wouldn't be
reliant on gasoline.

You'll be the most advanced
tribe of radioactive cannibals

in the whole
this version of the world.

Wait. Can you stay
to show us more?

You don't have to ask me twice.
Home is nuts right now.

My daughter's going through
a divorce,

and I am not dealing with it
in a healthy way at all.

[ ELECTRICITY ZAPPING]

Ugh, God damn it.

Hi, there, Summer!

How were the ruins today?

Oh, you know, Eli.

Same shit, different day.

Hey, Summer!
Guess what.

One man entered, one man
comes out in nine months.

Oh.
Congratulations, guys.

Uh, Summer, one more thing.

We noticed that you've been
putting scrap metal

in the blue bin.

I got it.

[SIGHS]
She's a piece of work.

They both are, right?

[ DOOR CLOSES]

- I'm home.
- Hey, babe.

- Ah, Summer's home!
- Hey, there she is!

You haven't moved since I left
to scavenge this morning.

Blood Dome playoffs.

So, I can assume you haven't
murdered a single person today.

Oh, I don't know.

L-I didn't mark my murders
in my murder log.

I didn't know that's how
we measured success.

Oh, there he is.

There's the nihilistic brute
I married,

except now life only means
nothing when I'm talking to him

and everything means everything
when it's on fucking TV!

Jesus Christ.
When did you become a monster?

I was a monster when you met me!

We were monsters!

- We didn't care about anything!
- I still don't!

Yeah, except I'm the only one
in this entire world

that's still committed to that!

Ohh.
Ding, ding, ding!

Wow.
Everybody hear that? Wow.

- Uh, we should go to the garage.
- Oh, my God.

- Uh-huh.
- La-di-da-di-fuckin'-da.

The only one
committed to not caring?

I got to admit, Rick,
when you popped this scheme,

I-I-I didn't -- I wasn't sure
it was gonna work.

Come on, Morty.

No union built on
running from your problems

lasts more than five years,
seven tops.

Grandpa just sped things up

with a few creature comforts
of modern society.

Hemorrhage and I are
taking some time apart.

Oh, no. Sum-sum, no.

But you two were
perfect for each other.

Oh, cut the crap, Rick, okay?
You proved your point.

I get it.
Let's just go home.

Coolsies!

I am alive!

Morty, are you okay?

You know what? Yeah.

I think if Dad really
wanted to be here,

he'd stop at nothing
to make that happen.

You know, maybe Dad just doesn't
want you back,

or maybe he just doesn't
have the strength to fight.

I-In either case,
he's got his life, I got mine.

Yeah.

Hey, who wants to go
run in a stream?

What the fuck?
No.

D-Do we have any oranges?

I think I got
a scurvy coming on.

[SIREN WAILING]

Summer.

This is the first mutant
I killed in the poison zone.

I was raiding his hovel.

He had a chance to escape,
but he looked back,

which is something
we shouldn't do,

which is why I shouldn't believe
in souvenirs or trinkets

or symbols
or housewarming gifts,

but, Dad, I wanted to give you
this as a reminder...

not to look back.

Thanks.

I know
the perfect place for it,

which is why I'm going to
put it somewhere else --

because everything's bullshit.
Am I right?

Cool.

So...lots of hookers
outside, huh?

Is that what they are?

[DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING]

[WHISTLING]

- Aah!
[COYOTE SNARLING]

H-Hello there.
Nice doggy.

You -- You want a snack?

You -- You want
my unemployment check?

-[ COYOTE SNARLS]
- You can tell the difference?

-[ COYOTE BARKS ]
- And you want this one?

[COYOTE SNARLS]

But this is actual food,
and this would nourish you.

And this, it's just paper
that only has value to me.

Unless my suffering
is your nourishment?

[ COYOTE HOWLS ]

- Jesus. Okay.

Morty?!

- Morty!
- Rick?

- RICK: Hey, Morty?!
- Rick?

Are you far away,
or are you inside something?

Is this a camera?

Is everything a camera?

RICK:
Morty, the garage, Morty.

Come to the garage!

- Morty?
- Rick? W-Where are you?

RICK:
On my work bench, Morty.

Are you invisible and you're
gonna, like, fart on me?

RICK:
Flip the pickle over.

What, I'm gonna touch it,

and you're gonna tell me it's
an alien dick or something.

RICK: Come on,
flip the pickle, Morty.

You're not gonna regret it.
The payoff is huge.

I turned myself
into a pickle, Morty!

Boom! Big reveal --
I'm a pickle.

What do you think about that?

I turned myself into a pickle!

W-What are you just
staring at me for, bro?

I turned myself
into a pickle, Morty!

- And?
- And?

What more do you want
tacked on to this?

I turned myself into a pickle,
and 9/11 was an inside job.

- Was it?
- Who cares, Morty?

Global acts of terrorism
happen every day.

Uh, here's something
that's never happened before --

I'm a pickle.

I'm Pickle Rick!

[DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYS]

Are you going to,
I mean, you know --

Is this the first part
of some kind of magic trick?

I don't do magic, Morty,
I do science.

One takes brains,
the other takes dark eyeliner.

Well, can you move?
Can you fly?

Wouldn't be much
of a pickle if I could.

All right, well, do pickles
live forever or --

Morty, stop digging for hidden
layers and just be impressed.

- I'm a pickle.
-|-I'm just trying

to figure out
why you would do this --

why anyone would do this.

The reason anyone would
do this is, if they could,

which they can't,
would be because they could,

-which they can't.
-[ DOOR OPENS]

Morty, we have to get going,
or we're gonna be late.

- Where's your grandpa?
- RICK: Right here, sweetie.

- I'm a pickle!
- What?!

Why would you -- Ugh!

Look, we're running late.
We have to go.

W-Where are you guys going?

We have an appointment
downtown

that was set a week ago
and agreed upon by everyone,

including you.

Oh, my God. Beth, oh,
it totally slipped my mind.

Geez, oh, man.
I'm a pickle.

I mean, I don't know
if I can -- Ooh, geez.

Rick, did you do this on purpose
to get out of family counseling?

- Morty!
- It's okay, Beth.

I understand Morty's suspicion.

I've misled him before.

Morty, turn me so we're
making eye contact.

Morty, I assure you,
I would never <i>find</i> a way

to get out of family therapy.

I hope my lack of fingers
doesn't prevent

the perception of my air quotes.

Can't you just turn yourself
back into a human?

Great question, Summer.

The unfortunate answer is
I did this to challenge myself.

And it could take hours
or even days

before I'm able to figure out
how to return to human form.

But, I mean, you know,
your mom could put me

in a purse or a pocket,
you know,

if she really needs me to go.

Nobody needs anything.
Okay, it's fine.

I mean, you should just
stay here and figure out

how to stop being
a pickle, okay?

Hey, Rick, why is there
a syringe of mysterious fluid

hanging directly over you?

Also, why is the string
attached to it running through

a pair of scissors
attached to a timer?

And why is the timer set
to 10 minutes from now,

exactly when we would
have left for therapy?

Well, Morty, if you must know,

the syringe is completely
unrelated to this discussion

and, therefore, does not warrant
further explanation.

Enough. Kids, it's time to go.
We don't want to be late.

W-W-What are you
doing there, Beth?

W-What are you doing there,
sweetie?

Well, I mean, you don't
want to get pierced by a needle

full of liquid unrelated
to your situation.

How's that gonna help?

Can't argue with that.

Great.
We'll see you later.

Hey, hey, be careful with that.

- It's for something else.
-[ Car doors open, close]

-[ ENGINE STARTS]
- It's really important,

so don't break it.

Of cucumbers and pickles because
they think they're snakes.

Whoa! [GRUNTS]

Oh! Whoa, whoa, whoa!

Oh, crap, that sun is bright.

Yes!

How is this even family therapy

if Dad's not invited
and Grandpa won't come?

Yeah, and what's courageous
about eating a hot dog?

It's nobody's choice
to be here, you knobs.

The family was told to get
counseling by your principal,

even though it's not
the family that was

huffing pottery glaze
in the art room

and desk wetting
in history class.

-[ DOOR OPENS]
- Oh, the Smith family,

minus a dad.

You're patients
of Dr. Wong, too?

Temporarily --
by order of the school.

Me too. How long have
you all been eating poop?

We...have never...eaten poop.

Uh, me, neither.

Say, where did my family
get off to? [CHUCKLES]

Smith family, I'm Dr. Wong.

Come on in.

I was told there was a grandpa
that might be joining us?

He got wrapped up
in an experiment.

He's a scientist.

Like, legit,
like on a an inter-galactic,

sci-fi level.
His work is very --

He turned himself into a pickle.

Morty, Mom's talking.
I'm sorry.

I suppose that's a good segue

into our little
discipline cases here.

Does Grandpa turn himself
into a pickle a lot?

What?! No!
What kind of question is that?

The kind that wasn't designed to
attack or hurt you in any way.

Oh, Jesus Christ, one of these.

No, my father has never turned
himself into a pickle before.

He's unpredictable
and eccentric.

The whole family is.
Speaking of which...

Okay, let's open things up
to the whole family,

and let me ask this.

Why do we think Grandpa
turned himself into a pickle?

[SAWING]

[SIGHS]

Wow. Ugh!

[SNARLING]

Hey, listen, I know this
is your world, not mine.

The sooner I can get out,
the sooner I can go back

to taking big craps, and you can
go back to subsisting on them.

You are one driven rat.

Could you be
a little more driven?

To the right.

Yes, yes, yes!

Come on, come on, come on!
Fresh, fresh, fresh!

Whoa, whoa, whoa,
was this your friend?

Don't worry, he died
doing what he loved,

being a dumb fucking rat.

[GRUNTS]

[SNARLING, SCREECHING]

[DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYS]

Oh, yeah!

[GRUNTING]

[LAUGHS]

[RATS SQUEALING]

[GRUNTING]

Aaaah!

I didn't say
my father is perfect,

I said his work is important.

And she's saying
what's important is

that Grandpa lied to you
to get out of coming here.

Oh, he did not!

Let's do an experiment here.

I get the impression
this family values science.

So raise your hand
if you feel certain

you know what was
in the syringe.

Raise your hand
if you know for certain

the syringe does not
contain anti-pickle serum.

Beth, your hand did
a little thing there.

Do you really not see
what's happening here?

- Tell me.
- Well, Dr. Wong --

by the way, racist name --

obviously, Morty and Summer
are seizing on your

arbitrary pickle obsession
as an end run

around what was supposed
to be <i>their</i> therapy.

Oh, I think this pickle incident
is a better path than any other

to the heart of
your family's dysfunction.

I think it's possible
that you and your father

have a very specific dynamic.

I don't think it's one

that rewards emotion
or vulnerability.

I think it may punish them.

I think it's possible that
dynamic eroded your marriage

and is infecting
your kids with a tendency

to misdirect their feelings.

Fuck you.

'Mom!
'Mom!

Fuck both of you, too.

[SNARLING]

By the way, you might notice
that in spite of

your numerous
distinctive features

[GROWLS] I never gave you a name
like Scar or Stripe or Goliath.

That's because, to me,
you aren't special.

You were special to rats.
Now they're dead.

I guess it was me
you should have impressed.

God damn it, I love myself.

Pickle Rick!

is this?

[ALARM BLARING]

What is it?

[RUSSIAN ACCENT]
A pickle? A rat? Both.

[RUSSIAN ACCENT]
It says it's a scientist.

Where is it?

It seems to be
using the air ducts

and the mail tubes
to get around.

It's been gathering
office supplies, we think,

to build weaponry.

But look what it did
on the mezzanine.

It transferred a bottle from
the trash to the recycling bin.

Whatever this thing is,
it's shaming us.

We have 34 armed guards,
and we can't kill a pickle?

32 armed guards.

He killed two.

It's on the phone.

Put him on, and locate
the phone he's using.

-[ PHONE BEEPS]
- Hello.

RICK: Hi, um, can you, uh
[BELCHES] please let me out?

Your mere presence
in this building

violates international law.

I couldn't let you out even
if you hadn't killed two men.

You should know
those men killed themselves.

PAVEL:
And how is that?

RICK: They didn't
[BELCHES] let me out.

Solen'ya.

Shut your mouth
and do your jobs,

you fucking children!

Uh, is this not
a good time or...

Some of my men
are calling you "Solen'ya" --

the Pickle Man,
an old wives' tale.

He crawls from
bowls of cold soup

to steal the dreams
of wasteful children.

RICK:
That'd be a lucky break for you.

Go, shoot to kill.

Aaah!

[ BOTH SCREAM ]

[GUNFIRE IN DISTANCE]

[RUSSIAN ACCENT]
We got him.

- Ah.
- Ah.

RICK:
Because this pickle

doesn't care about
your children.

And I'm not gonna
take their dreams.

I'm gonna take their parents.

[ BEEPING ]

[WHIRRING]

[WHIRRING]

[SCREAMING]

Solen'ya!
He's coming!

It's because I threw
halfway my sandwich!

He's just a pickle!

He's a monster.

He's not the only one.

[BEEP]

You can stay dead to the world
and die in this room.

Or you can kill a pickle for me
and earn your freedom.

There is no freedom while
your leader breathes.

Our country is a prison.

Then Catarina is a prisoner.

Perhaps I could arrange
her escape, as well.

She lives, Jaguar.

Where is this pickle?

What do you think is
in the syringe, Beth?

You're the one that costs
$200 an hour. You tell me.

- Anti-pickle serum.
- It's anti-pickle serum.

Your kids think it might be
anti-pickle serum.

My kids pee their desks
and suck on unbaked vases.

They're just angry at me
for divorcing their father.

I never said I was angry at you.

That's the point of
pottery-enamel huffing, Summer.

You do it so you
don't have to say,

"I'm angry at Mommy," out loud.

Oh, my God!
Oh, there --

there's pictures of people
eating poop in there!

It's not my job to take sides
or pass judgment.

Do you think when your father
asks for that syringe,

you could ask him --

He won't have to
ask for it, okay?

He won't need it.
He'll just make more.

He doesn't need
anything from anyone.

You admire him for that.

It's better than
making your problems

other people's problems.

[WHIRRING]

[SCREAMS]

Oh, come on!
[GRUNTS]

[SCREAMS]

[GROANS]

[SIGHS]

Pickle Man, you should
know this isn't personal!

You should know
that isn't original.

They have my daughter.

There's nothing I won't do
to see her again.

Yeah, there's lots I wouldn't do
to see my daughter,

but killing you gets me
to her quicker

than your derivative bullshit.

[GROANING]

[ BOTH SCREAMING ]

I never bullshit, Pickle Man.

This can only end
with one of us dead,

and I have never died.

That will be your
downfall, Jaguar,

not being open
to new experiences.

[GUNFIRE]

Is it done?

Jaguar?!

RICK:
Jaguar couldn't make it.

PAVE L:
Do it.

Okay, you win, Pickle Man.

I'm unsealing the building.

RICK: No, thanks.
I'm coming for you now.

Pickle Man, there's
$100 million worth of bonds

in a safe on level two.

I'll give you the combination.

That money belongs
to the people.

Shut up and call me
a helicopter, you prick!

Do we have a deal?!

RICK: Take that money,
give it to Jaguar's daughter

when you set her free.

Or I'll be visiting you.

PAVEL:
Jaguar's daughter is dead.

Huh, so you're a liar.

PAVEL:
Jaguar was an animal.

You're an intelligent pickle.

We can do business.

RICK: I don't think so.
See you soon.

- Is the helicopter here?
- Yes.

And the police are on the way.
What do we tell them?

'Ooh!
- Aah!

Tell them we were robbed.

[HELICOPTER BLADES WHIRRING]

Hey!
Hey, what are you doing?!

I'm right here!

Farewell, Solen'ya.

F-15s are scrambled.

This helicopter will be
shot down in seven minutes.

Well, my daughter
is about five away,

and I've got about
eight to live.

Pickle Man, it's too late
for me to tell my daughter

I love her, but not for you.

Oh, well, uh, she knows.

I mean, we don't really
buy into that kind of crap.

To the extent that love
is an expression

of familiarity over time,
my access to infinite timelines

precludes the necessity
of attachment.

In fact, I even abandoned
one of my infinite daughters

in an alternate version of earth
that was taken over by mutants.

Okay.
Good luck with that.

Wait. Do I have
infinite daughters?

Huh? Uh, no.
No, nope, sorry about that.

Nope, just me.

Yeesh!

L...

am...

afraid...

that my kids will get expelled.

Good.
Summer, you go.

I am mad...

that I can't huff enamel

without people assuming
it's because my family sucks.

I hope to be seen one day

as someone that just
likes getting high.

Good job.

Morty, do you have
an "I" statement?

I am sad...

that I peed.

I'm sad that I peed in class
instead of a toilet.

Look at this family go.
You guys are pros.

What do you guys think about
doing this once a week?

Ugh.

[GRUNTS]

[GROANS]

- You must be Rick.
- Mm-hmm.

I've heard a lot
about you today.

Your family is crazy about you.

Your daughter holds you
in very high regard.

You're a lucky fella.

Yeah, thank you.
Uh, sweetie, you don't still

happen to have that syringe
in your purse?

Dad...

I would like you to tell me
what's in the syringe.

It's a serum that I need to,
uh -- to stay alive.

I have had a rough day.

And, uh, I've sustained
a lot of damage.

I'm pretty close to death,
which the serum will prevent.

By changing you from
a pickle to a human.

Yes.

Rick, why did you lie
to your daughter?

So I wouldn't have to come here.

Why didn't you want
to come here?

Because I don't respect therapy,
because I'm a scientist.

Because I invent, transform,
create, and destroy

for a living, and when
I don't like something

about the world, I change it.

And I don't think going to
a rented office in a strip mall

to listen to some
agent of averageness

explain which words
mean which feelings

has ever helped
anyone do anything.

I think it's helped a lot
of people get comfortable

and stop panicking,
which is a state of mind

[BURPS] we value
in the animals we eat

but not something
I want for myself.

I'm not a cow.

I'm a pickle --
when I feel like it.

So...you asked.

Rick, the only
connection between

your unquestionable intelligence
and the sickness

destroying your family
is that everyone in your family,

you included, use intelligence
to justify sickness.

You seem to alternate
between viewing your own mind

as an unstoppable force
and as an inescapable curse.

And I think
it's because the only

truly unapproachable
concept for you

is that it's your mind
within your control.

You chose to come here.

You chose to talk,
to belittle my vocation,

just as you chose
to become a pickle.

You are the master
of your universe,

and yet you are dripping
with rat blood and feces,

your enormous mind literally
vegetating by your own hand.

I have no doubt that
you would be bored senseless

by therapy, the same way
I'm bored when I brush my teeth

and wipe my ass.

Because the thing
about repairing,

maintaining, and cleaning is
it's not an adventure.

There's no way to do it
so wrong, you might die.

It's just work.

And the bottom line is,

some people are okay going
to work, and some people...

well, some people
would rather die.

Each of us gets to choose.

-[ WATCH BEEPS ]
- That's our time.

I'm going to
give you guys my card

and hope to hear
from you again.

And if you have any friends
or family that eat poop

and would like to stop,
give them my number.

I, um...

I'm sorry I lied
to get out of the thing.

- I -- I shouldn't lie to you.
- Oh, it's fine.

I mean, thank you,
and, yeah, you shouldn't.

But I hope you know
that's not what

that session was supposed to be.

Oh, no, I mean, I know
it was Morty peeing his pants

and Summer snorting glue
or whatever...

[BETH LAUGHS]

She huffed enamel, and we never
even talked about it.

RICK: Well, there was
so much more at stake.

[BETH LAUGHS]

RICK: I mean, that shrink,
what a monologuist.

Are we gonna go back?

Sweetie, could I get --
get that syringe now?

Oh, my God, yes!
Dad, it's in my purse.

Oh, I'm sorry.
You must be in agony.

Eh.

[GROANS]

[COUGHING]

Jesus.

[COUGHS]

Jesus Christ.
Therapists, man.

Weird breed.

Man, I missed having hands...

and blood and a stomach.

We should get a drink.

Really?
Like, go somewhere?

Yeah, let's drop the kids off
and go tie one on.

Absolutely.

L-I liked her.

So what are you thinking,
like, Smokey's Tavern?

Maybe Shoney's?

Yeah,either one.
Either one.

[DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYS]

RICK: You'll never get away
with this, Concerto.

That is where you're mistaken,
Mr. Sanchez.

This shall be my greatest
performance of all time!

["MOONLIGHT SONATA" PLAYS]

RICK: This is it, Morty.
We're goners.

We're not getting
out of this one.

After everything
we've been through,

this is how we're gonna die.

Make peace with your god.

Oh, geez, Rick,
I-I-I don't want to die!

And now for the E-splat!

[GRUNTS]

Jaguar!

Who -- Who was that, Rick?

That, Morty, is why
you don't go to therapy.

﻿What's new at school?

- Nothing.
- Nothing!

Oh, uh, one
of the lunch ladies died.

They found her in the gym with,
like, two holes in her neck

and all the blood drained
out of her.

Good lord! Who does
something like that?

Obviously a vampire.
W-W-Where's the pepper?

Wait, what?! Vampires are real?!

Yes, Summer, vampires
are real. Who knew?

Oh, right, all humanity,
for hundreds of years, now.

Yeah, Summer,
it's a big universe.

Get used to it. R-Right, Rick?

Well, what are we going to do?!

We're gonna live our lives
until we die.

Possibly by vampire.
More likely auto accident

or heart disease,
but possibly vampire.

Grandpa Rick, couldn't you,
like, use your superknowledge

to turn yourself into a teenager
and come to our school

and help us hunt
the vampire down?

Um... Wow.

Yeah, pretty specific
pitch, Summer.

I probably could
turn myself into a teenager

and hang out in the
zit-covered, hormone-addled,

low-stakes assworld
that is high school.

But here's my reverse-ask...

Why in the fuck
would I ever do that, ever?

And how dare you even
ask me that?

And why aren't you more
ashamed of yourself?

- Dad!
- Be ashamed of yourself, sweetie.

Jerry! Do you know what you
just said to our daughter?

Sor-ry! I wasn't
paying attention.

To a conversation
about vampires?!

Clearly, I didn't know
it was about vampires,

because I wasn't
paying attention,

which you would know,

if you ever
paid attention to me!

Oh, here we go,
right to the victim role.

Am I a victim, Beth,

or am I married
to a mean, unfair monster

that always hurts me?!

Jesus Christ!
Will you fix your marriage...

or get a divorce already?

Well, we tried
a couples' therapist.

That's Earth therapy.

You might as well ask a horse
to fix a merry-go-round.

I mean, he'll try his best, but mostly,
he's just gonna get horrified.

I know about a place off-planet
with a 100% success rate.

Well, we want to make it
work, if we can.

It's just... Then it's settled.

- No need to pack.
- Oh!

Let's go, go, go, go!
[ DOOR OPENS, CLOSES ]

Do you think Mom and Dad
are, you know,

gonna get a divorce?

I think it's okay
to dream, Morty.

I'm gonna go make
some wooden stakes.

I booked you for a two-day
intensive at Nuptia Four,

the galaxy's most successful
couples' counseling institute.

They could save
the marriage of a dog

and a bar of dark chocolate.

They could save the marriage

of a porn star and a porn star.

Well, I know I'm ready
to try whatever it takes.

Which clearly implies
that I'm not.

It's not a competition, Beth.

Oh is that how
you're gonna try to win,

by implying I'm competitive?
If the shoe fits.

- My shoe fits up your ass.
- You wish!

RICK: Okay, have fun.
See ya Thursday!

JERRY: Oh!

- Jerk.
- Don't insult my father.

He's the reason our kids
are only half-stupid.

Ha! You just called yourself...

Oh.

- Beth and Jerry Smith?
- Yes.

I'm Glaxo Slimslom.

Welcome to Nuptia Four.

Your marriage can rest easy now.

Jerry, go ahead and sit
there and put this on.

This machine isolates
the part of the subject's brain

containing all perceptions
of its romantic partner.

And we will now render
Jerry's perception of Beth

with artificial biological life.

- [ GROWL ]
- GLAXO: Interesting.

What the hell is that?!
Take that back!

You do not think that about me!

I didn't do anything!
They scanned it out of my brain.

Can I take it back?

There's nothing to regret.

We're dealing with
unconscious, unhealthy thoughts.

Beth.

Now, we scan for Beth's
perceptions of Jerry.

- Scan hard. He's dead to me.
- Everything's dead to you.

- What?
- Nothing.

[ WHIMPER ]

Read it and weep, bitch.

[ CRYING ] Does everybody
see what I mean?

I think we all see
what you both mean.

[ BELL RINGS ]

Any leads on the vampire?

No, Summer! I mean, you know,

I think it might be time
that we just l-let it go.

Oh, so, now, you're
too cool for this,

just because Grandpa Rick is?

It's not that, it's just
that the universe

is a little too big to care
about something so small.

- Aah!
- What up, my Helsings?

Who wants to hunt
a vampire? Ha ha ha!

Rick? How... How did you...

Yeah, I got bored
and then, I remembered,

this morning, how I blew
Summer off, and I thought,

"Hey, why are you such
a grumpy douche, Rick?"

Go to the garage,
transfer your mind

into a younger clone of
yourself,

and get embroiled
in some youthful hijinks.

"What's the BFD?" So here I am.

- I'm Tiny Rick!
- O-O-Okay.

Well, it's good
you're here, Rick.

I was pretty sure we
didn't have what it takes

to deal with
a bloodsucker on our own.

Don't short-sell
yourself, Summer.

You got everything it takes.
But it'll still be fun...

to do this as a fucking team,
motherfucker. Tiny Rick!

Yeah! Oh, my god, Toby Matthews!

Hey, Toby. I'm Tiny Rick.
I'm new.

Hey oh... Go easy on me.
Ha ha. Just kiddin'.

Hey, I like your
straightforward style

and that lab coat's pretty cool.

Summer.

He knows my name!

Why wouldn't he? You're great!

But, listen, just be careful.

We can't rule anybody out
as the vampire,

not even the dreamboats.

Stop, Tiny Rick.

Huntin' a vampire
with my grandkids!

Fuck! Tiny Ri-i-ck!

GLAXO: The next step is
to watch your mythologues

interact together
and, uh... big surprise...

It's never pretty. [ LAUGHTER ]

here we have the way

Garrrh and Zharbidar
perceive each other.

[ CHUCKLING ] As we can all see,

this is hardly the real
Garrrh and Zharbidar.

Which is good,
because the relationship

in their heads is not only ugly,

it's unsustainable. [ BEEP ]

[ ROAR ]

[ GROWLING ]

You may already be
learning something important...

All of these relationships
are different,

none of them are real,
and none of them work.

We are not the monsters
we sometimes see each other as,

because we are real
and we are functional.

That's what makes us
better than them.

We can find solutions.

We can adapt.

We can communicate.
- [ GROWL ]

And, most importantly,

we can work together.

SUMMER: Well, it was a tough
adventure, but it paid off...

Our school is vampire-free!

Man, who would've
suspected Coach Feratu?

You did great, guys.
Couldn't have done it without ya.

You know, we... w-we
should be proud of ourselves.

We killed a vampire

Ha ha ha.
Talk about two-for-one, right?!

So, how, exactly,
is your old body living

in there, Grandpa Rick?

Oh, you know,
hyperbaric quantum fluid,

[ BURP ]... that kind of thing.
It preserves living tissue.

Not that there was much
to preserve.

Look at that mummy! Ha! Ha ha!

And I guess it's time for me
to get back inside the old-timer.

Oh, my god.
Toby Matthews is asking...

if my parents
are still out of town

and if we can have a party!

All right, way to go, Summer!
What did I tell you?

Ohh! He's asking
if Tiny Rick will be here.

Well, you know what, Summer?

Tell him Tiny Rick will be here!

And tell him to bring
some brews!

For real? Y-Y-Y-You

What's the... What's...
What's... What's...

What's the...
What's the problem?

Look at his art, Morty.

I've got an emo streak.
Part of what makes me so rad.

Why does it say "help me
Morty and Summer!"?

Come on, Summer,
that's the title of the art.

Why was Knight Rider
called Knight Rider?

The car's name was Kitt.
Nobody rode Michael Knight.

You're overthinking it, Summer.
I'm Tiny Rick!

Grandpa, I think that,
when you put your mind

into this body's young brain,

it did what young brains do...

It shoved the bad
thoughts into the back

and put a wall around them.

But those bad thoughts
are the real Rick.

The fact that you're old,

the fact that we're all
going to die one day,

the fact that the universe
is so big,

nothing in it matters...
Those facts are who you are.

So you're trapped in there
and you can only come out

in the form of
Tiny Rick's teen angst!

Well, Summer, I hear

Toby Matthews
isn't into psycho chicks.

Can't think of anyone that is.

I'll see you motherfuckers
at the dance! Tiny Rick!

Morty, you have to help me!

Summer, he's happy! I'm happy!

I-I-Is that why
you're doing this,

you don't want me
and Rick to be happy?

- No.
- Then get your shit together!

Get it all together
and put it in a backpack.

All your shit, so it's together.

And if you gotta
take it somewhere,

graduated high school.

Aha, you see?
What did I tell you two?

It worked.

You know what, Rick?
I guess, in a way...

Already lost interest.
Get in the car.

I've been inside a kid
all day and, now,

I can feel my bones
scraping each other.

Uh, just so you're prepared,

there's a bunch of dead mes
in the garage.

Huh! Sounds like our stories
were connected by a theme.

Probably a cosmetic connection

Coach Feratu's presence was
discovered by the humans.

He has been destroyed.
No bother.

The mortals shall soon...

I'm sorry, what did you
say his name was?

- Coach Feratu.
- Coach Feratu.

That was his real name,
like his actual vampire name?

No no no no. His vampire
name was Balik Alistane.

Why the fuck
would he name himself

after a famous vampire movie?
Was he doing a bit?

I do not know, your unholiness.

Jesus fucking Christ.

From now on, no more of
this clever-name bullshit.

When a vampire is pretending
to be a human,

they can just call themselves

Alan Jefferson

for that kind of breakthrough.

That was really traumatizing!
I quit! I'm out!

don't... don't be like that.

The Universe is a crazy,

You're the one that's
crazy and chaotic!

Adventures are supposed
to be simple and fun.

Oh, yeah, Morty, yeah.

Yeah, that... that... that's

real easy to say from the
sidekick position.

But... but, uh, how about
next time you be in charge,

and then we'll talk about
how simple and fun it is?

Seriously, Rick?

Y-y-you'll... you'll
let me call the shots?

Okay, yeah, fine.

But let's make it interesting,
Morty.

and we bail halfway through it,

you lose the right to bitch
about all future adventures.

my laundry for a month.

this mayonnaise jar?

and all sorts of fantasy things.

W-we're going on a quest, okay?

Ahem. Excuse me!

We are two humble heroes

I lost that wide-eyed

it means setting them free.

Try again and
keep your head down.

Okay, well, which is it?

Square my shoulders
or keep my head down?

Well, it's both.

But most importantly,
you got to relax.

You know what, Mr. Meeseeks?

I don't think this is working.

I give up.

I'm sorry, Jerry,
but it doesn't work like that.

I'm Mr. Meeseeks.

I have to fulfill my
purpose so I can go away.

sucks!

not how it went down!

Oh, well, it's going
down like that.

You're both going down like that.

Ooh, boy, Morty, you're really
showing me how it's done.

and fun.

Like, letting go of the
need to be popular is what

makes people like you.

The most important love you
can receive is from yourself.

Okay, Jerry, you got to
just choke up on the club!

Well, which is it,
choke up or follow-through?!

Aww, come on, Jerry,
we've been over this.

You know you got to do both!

This is as frustrating
for us as it is for you.

Don't tell me that!

That just puts pressure on me!

Just try to relax.

You try to relax!

Have you ever tried to relax?!

It is a paradox!

Ugh, these Meeseeks, huh?

Kind of a handful.

I can't imagine what you
two must be going through.

Our Meeseeks have been
gone for hours, Jerry.

You're kidding me.

Notice anything different?

I-I-I'm sorry. Hours?

Dad, mom is a beautiful woman!

Look at her!

You will lose her!

Uhh...

Hey, Jerry, you mind if we
get back to the task at hand?

Meeseeks don't usually
have to exist this long.

It's getting weird.

Order in the court!

Before the jury
reaches its verdict,

I just want to say that I
consider you both very guilty.

Oh, great adventure, buddy.

Rick and Morty
go to giant prison.

You know, if somebody
drops the soap,

it's gonna land on our heads
and crush our spines, Morty.

You know, i-i-i-it'll be really
easy to rape us after that.

We're gonna be okay, Rick.

How?

They took my portal gun.

This is an open-and-shut case,
Morty.

think's gonna happen,

some magical angel's
gonna show up and then...

of civil liberties!

hand a motion to dismiss.

is what I meant.

I-I-I'm deconstructing
our... our... our thing we say.

For giants. Nobody got that?

Oh, man, what did
I tell you, Rick?

We did it!

All right, Morty, looks like
the portal gun's still working.

You ready to head home?

Oh, yeah, you'd like that,
wouldn't you, Rick?

Well, you know what?

We're not bailing out just yet.

You know, w-we're gonna go
find some treasure or...

or something and...

and we're gonna bring
it to those villagers.

Morty, cut your losses.

This is obviously a wash.

Yeah, you were saying
that back...

back w-w-w-when we first got
arrested, but here we are,

the courthouse steps.

part of the adventure.

of the story everybody loves...

wouldn't be included, stupid.

do you know?

or something built right into

the side of the step.

about some scotch whiskey?

You got any of that around here?

Or just a bunch
of nonsense words?

We'll have two Bloogies, please.

And, uh, we were wondering, is
there a faster way two heroes

could get down these stairs?

Y'all need to
ride down the stairs?

My name is Slippely-Slippery Stair.

I'll take you down
there for 25 shmeckels.

25 shmeckels?

I-I-I don't know how much...
I don't know what that is.

Is that a lot?
Is it a little?

That's exactly how much
I spent on my big fake boobies.

Hi, I'm Mr. Booby Buyer.

I'll buy those boobies
for 25 shmeckels.

It's a tempting offer,
but I'm gonna have to decline.

Rats! What a shame.

Morty, your adventure's
in a spiral.

For real, man, time to pull out.

You keep heckling my adventure,
Rick!

You know why?

Uh, because it's lame?

It's because you're petty!

You know, h-how many times have

I had to follow you into some
nonsensical bull crap?

I always roll with
the punches, Rick.

Why can't you?

Look, I got to take a leak,
and when I come back,

i-if you haven't learned how to
lighten up, don't be here!

Whatever.

It's become clear...
look at me...

that if we concentrate all our
efforts on Jerry's

follow-through,
we will solve this problem.

I'm Mr. Meeseeks.

I'm Mr. Meeseeks.

The only thing that's clear
is that choking up is

the one true solution.

for two days,

We didn't see nothin'.

But surely our ancestors must
have left some evidence behind.

Why is he nervous?

Because, uh,
you're dinosaurs.

It's weird.

Thought you were dead.

Moving on, we "dinosaurs"
evolved here on Earth

until our technology
was planetarily harmonic.

That being the goal

with technology.

After we achieved perfect
balance with Mother Earth,

our best and bravest left
to help other planets.

Over millions of years,
we've called many worlds home

and helped
each one flourish.

Imagine our surprise
upon returning home

to find our species extinct
and Earth now in the care of...

you guys.

When we left,
you were basically squirrels.

Well, uh,
we've come a long way,

and we -- We've buried
a lot more than nuts.

We've evolved past
nonconstructive criticism,

so let's agree
you've done your best.

You're still alive.

But surely there was some point
between gunpowder

and something called
Amazon Prime

that you folks
had to think,

"Are we supposed to be
running a planet?

Wouldn't we rather make...

Marvel movies?"

How many Marvel movies
have you made?

29,
and 14 more on the way.

See, you love doing that.

And we love helping new
life-forms get their footing.

So now that we're back, we can
respectfully take it from here.

Now, hold on.
If you've seen "Endgame,"

you know invasion
is not something

Earth takes lying down.

This is not an invasion.

Besides, wouldn't you like
to lie down?

Ugh.
You must be exhausted.

Put your feet up,
get more tattoos,

finish rounding out
this "Ant-Man" character.

Think of it like your Earth
concept of "vacation,"

except permanent.

I think I speak
for all world leaders

when I say that the poor people
would just murder us

if we made you leave,
so...

welcome home, dinosaurs.

Oh.
I could use a vacation.

Should we nuke them?
I'm on vacation, Curtis.

Well, you leaned into this
fast.

Zuniceratops

Elvisaurus

Bambiraptor

Erectopus

Dracorex hogwartsia

Gojirasaurus

Vulcanodon

Sauroniops

Phuwiangosaurus

Those are
real dinosaur names

Ugh. I can't even pretend
to feel useful in a game.

This is how humanity's
story ends?

Relieved of duty and sat
at the kids' table?

I gotta respect
these dinosaurs.

They dominated
a whole species

just by calling its bluff
about wanting more free time.

They didn't even dominate us

because we're not worth
a fight to them.

We've become
biological Tyler Perry movies.

All they've done is help.
We didn't need their help.

We were not the problem.

This house recycles.

They sort it at
the trash facility.

What the "F"?
My dance videos

are getting,
like, zero likes now.

Oh, yeah. The dinos
kicked pedophiles off TikTok.

Great.
So now I'm broke?

You don't need money
anymore.

So what's this for
now?

Phone calls? Ugh.

Oh, c'mon, Dad.
You don't hate this, too?

Why would I? I-I was
already doing what I wanted.

I do think
it's kind of funny

that you're all basically
Jerry now.

Fuck.

Jerry,
how do you do it?

-Yeah, Dad, how do you do it?
-How do you do it, Dad?

- Huh?
- How do you do it?

It's finally happened.

All right.

Does anyone know how to
mail things to publishers?

Uhp.
President only pages me

if it's an emergency
or he needs Molly.

I'm sure glad
you stayed open, Beau.

Wish we could pay,

but no more capitalism.

I never make ribs
for the money, Mr. President.

Oh, um, here ya go.

That's not why I called.

Drugs can't solve
this problem.

I can't live
like this anymore.

At first it was fun
spending all day

watching whatever
YouTube autoplays

after the last
one autoplayed,

but a man can only watch
so many ads for Grammarly.

Rick. Please.

You're not bound
by morality.

Get rid of them.
Slit their necks.

Zero Dark Thirty these fuckers
for the good of the species.

I won't tell.
Help us go back to the old days,

where we pretend to fix
the problems we caused.

You think
I'm gonna side with you

over
hyper-intelligent creatures

operating way beyond
your comprehension?

I have more in common
with them than you.

You pompous
autistic cadaver!

You think you're above this?
I ought to...

Look here, Mr. President.

When I need my ribs
to be tender and delicious,

I pamper them.

See, if you give someone
what they want,

they'll give you
what you need.

I'm jus' saying.

I see your point, Beau.

All right, Rick.
Ha ha.

Name your price.

-Aw, crap.
-God damn it.

How often are you
"Westworld-ing" me?

Hang on. Rib-tips jammed
his folk-chip again.

Ol' reliable Rick.

Always k-knows what to do.

What do you want, Rick?
Trustworthy.

I won't stoop to answering
that again.
Honest.

You know exactly what I want.

I can't just snap my fingers
and get you that job.

Yeah, yeah.
Thanks for lunch.

Fine. Fine!

If you get rid
of the dinosaurs...

you can host the Oscars.

Yes!
Righteous R-Rick.

Straight shootin',
t-truth-tellin',

never wets the bed.

Goodbye, old friends.

May you rest in peace,

rather than the tank
of an S.U.V.

Hello,
fellow cosmic voyagers.

Can we help you?

Actually, I can
probably help you.

See, I'm technically human,
but I've come to be more,

you know, on your level.

We're fine,
thank you.

Maybe I'm being
too indirect.

I happen to dabble
in multiversal travel,

and I could probably zap
you guys to an alternate Earth.

We used portal travel eons ago,
but evolved to a one-universe,

one-truth policy as
the highest form of existence.

Sort of a "put
your own oxygen mask on

before helping others"
type of a thing.

Have you been on a plane?

Yes,
I've been on a plane.

We have no problem
if you jump dimensions.

Although we sense your gateway
device is suboptimal.

Let us help.
I don't need help.

I-I'm here to help you.

What the hell is this?

A "Portal Pistol."

The gateways are see-through,
not a green swirl,

so now you can see
where you're going.

Clever girl.

If you'd like,
we could patch up

your little interdimensional
rift too.

No, leave it.
I know how to close that.

That's there for a reason.
Very canonical.

Don't you
just want it closed?

Morty,
whose team are you on?!

It's normal to be frustrated.
Here.

Oh, my God, are you
fucking kidding me?

Goodbye.
No. Wait.

What the fuuuuu...

Aah! Dr. Manhattan high-road
assholes teleporting me?
Ah! I saw my bones!

Why --
Why wasn't that painful?

They didn't even do it right.
My -- My -- My fly is down.

Your fly
was already down.

What are you doing
with that?

Rick,
it was a better --

Nothing from them
is better.

That thing had uptight Zen
snob germs all over it.

So, what, now you're
gonna fight them?

And prove we're violent
and stupid?

No. We're gonna find out
what they're hiding.

Only people who have really
fucked up in the past

have to virtue signal
this hard.

Look at Sean Penn.
But, Rick,

aren't these feelings, like,
what they're talking about?

Like, life gets, um...

"programmed for competition
by early stages of evolution."

Like, amoebas have to
fight amoebas for energy,

but once a species can get
enough sugar from a machine

to give itself diabetes,

it's allowed to start
thinking beyond conflict.

I mean, it's all
in their pamphlet.

Morty, you're a genius.

I clearly mean that
in the '90s ironic sense,

but this self-fellating zine
is a treasure map

to every fossilized bone
in their skeleton closet.

They're gonna call us
Laura Dern

because we're about to get
elbow deep in dino doo-doo.

Get it, Morty?
The gloves?

You -- You remember
the big gloves?

Yeah, no,
I get it, Rick.

I said "clever girl" earlier.
You didn't even react.

I was angry.

Um, I'm looking for a few
of my, uh, friends.

Hmm.
Kinda look like the Skullfeet

that used to live
on our planet way before us.

They're long gone now.
Really?

They're extinct here, too?
Yeah.

We keep their bones
in that museum over there.

Um, wow.

These guys aren't
gonna be much help.

The leading theory
is, the Skullfeet

stepped on their own brains
so much they straight-up died.

Such a shame. Would have loved
to hear them sing.

Sing?
Yeah.

We figured they used to hold
huge outdoor concerts

in their
land amphitheater.

You people are idiots.
Hey.

We didn't have much
to go by.

Bones aren't big
on conversation.

Yeah, neither are you,
pal.

The majestic Basketsaur.
Aren't they incredible?

We're even making a series
of increasingly terrible movies

about cloning them
in a theme park.

So what happened to them?
No idea.

But we do know they all loved
eating communal soup

out of
the Great Dirt Bowl.

Starting to see
a pattern here.

Breathtaking, aren't they?

It's a common misconception
that they roamed our planet.

The truth is, they rolled.

Street-style mostly.

Some vert.
Lemme guess.

There's a very large,
deep circular indentation

in which these "Grindasaurs"
used to shred.

We think they had
a second brain in their butt

dedicated
to pulling 1080s.

Three planets visited
by dinosaurs,

three apocalyptic
meteor impacts.

Gi-- Gi--
Gimme the board.

I'm dropping in for data.

Aah!
Rick!

That's the hardest thing
in skateboarding.
Oh! Ow!

It looked so easy on --
aah -- "Pro Skater 3."

Oww.

Hello.

Jackpot, Morty.

You still think the dinosaurs
got something to hide?

No, Morty, they have
a reason to hide.

Come here,
ya little whippersnapper.
No, Rick, stop!

C'mere, Morty.
Come on, gimme a hug.
No, don't touch me.
Your hands are greasy.

What's the matter
with you?

It's become clear your species
is having a hard time

adjusting to
its reduced accountability.

Our solution is to hold these
regular keynotes, or talks,

which you used to launch
new phones and religions.

Uhp, I see someone's eager
to speak.

Hi. Um, what do you do
when you want to kill yourself?

You don't do that.
Thank you for asking, though.

Ver-- Very important.

We recently discovered a new
piece of human literature

that we think
everyone should read.

Holy shit!
I'm a famous author!

Wait, where's my name?

We will distribute it
to everyone on Earth tomorrow.

Excuse me. Aren't you gonna say
who wrote it?

Nope. Whoever wrote it
must be above needing credit.

It's all here in this book
that belongs to everyone.

For free.

You Communist lizard
scumbags!

I wrote that.

Me, Jerry Smith!

Hey, hey, hey!

Guess what.
Dinosaurs are not secretly evil,

and they're not out
to cause anybody trouble,

but it turns out trouble
has a way of following them.

Oh, yes, yes, yes.
It's showtime.

Literally every planet
with dinosaurs on it

is eventually smashed
by a huge space rock

that takes out them
and most existing life.

What?
That can't be true.

It's all right
to be frustrated.

Let me explain.

Why would planet-killing meteors
follow dinosaurs?

As these reptiles evolved
to higher and higher levels

of loving vegan godhood,

another life-form devolved
into an equally selfless,

hate-filled species
of barely sentient rocks.

They hurtle through space
and do as much damage

as they can to their chosen
enemy, which is guess who.

Yup,
everywhere these dinos go,

these rocks,
they come a-crashing.

And this one...

...is headed
directly towards us.

And all of our work?
It was for...

Nothing. Bingo.
Welcome to life.

It's a big boat
with a lot of holes,

but we're all in it together.

-Oh, my.
-Ohhhhh.

Mm.
So much death.

Congratulations, primates.

Looks like Earth could
have done worse.

Rick out. Oh.

And don't forget to tune in
to this year's Oscars.

Well, this is
a -- a lot to take in.

I like trains now.

Okay, that hurt.

Trains rule!

Dinos drool!

And you had no idea about
the disastrous meteors

that followed in your wake?

We just learned about it
like you.

Truly heartbreaking news.

But I assume you're gonna
destroy it

when it arrives here, right?

Um, we're in the process
of finding a solution

that, um, doesn't
involve violence.

Hold on.
You're in the process?!

Well, there you have it,
Cooperheads.

An angry species of rock
is gonna slam into our --

sorry -- their planet,
and our new planet runners

are weighing
whether to let it happen.

I mean, no one knows if the
meteor species is even real.

No. It's very real.

We all know that.
You know what's real?

A rear naked choke hold.
I'll show you

-Hmm?
-What?

Final question --
How we doing?

We have come
to the conclusion the only way

to ensure humanity will be safe
is for us to go.

We are leaving the planet
for good.

Exxon spilling the oil

Chernobyl blowing up

Asbestos in Montana

Atlantic City

Type 2 diabetes

Deepwater deeply blew it

Giant garbage island

And all the bees are dying

Fuck off and die-nosaurs

Maybe it's the Molly,
but I fucking love you, Rick.

It's the Molly.
Isn't this nice?

Rivalries behind us,
dinos gone,

two cool guys
living in the moment.

So, uh, like, uh

you know what you're gonna wear?
Because --

I can't get another plus-one.
What?!

I'm the one who got you the gig,
you son of a bitch!

I feel this napkin --

Feel this napkin.

So soft.

This is
the 95th annual Academy Awards.

Now, please welcome your host,

an old science guy
who got rid of the dinosaurs...

Rick Sanchez.

Suck my gray tits
Hollywood pinkos.

Where's the mic?

The -- The --
The raising mic?

Ha.

Bring it up!

Tommy.

Tom Hanks is here.

C'mon. Do it.

Come on.

Do ittttt.

Okay, okay, one time.

"Wilson!"

I'm Oscar host Rick.

Grandpa Rick,
this is so cool.

That microphone bit killed.
Yeah, told you it would.

That was all scripted?

Every moment
at the Oscars is.

Even that one thing.
-Ha ha!

Look who stole themselves
a swag bag.

-Ah, fucking Sprinkles coupon!
-We're splitting that.

Hey, so I was thinking
it might be funny

to add dinosaurs
to the "In Memoriam."

Eh, it feels beneath us.

It's funnier that they left
and we don't even care.

Oh, yeah, they left, but they
keep begging for attention.

You haven't heard?

The dinos are just standing
up there on Mars

with their dicks
in their hands. So dramatic.

What, they're just gonna let
the meteor hit them a-and die?

Good. If being superior
to everyone makes you die,

I call that balance.

It's all in
my globally published book

the dinos
stripped my name from!

Ugggh.
Oscars are over.

Where are my keys?

God damn it, I need
to fix portal travel.

And -- And I'm going to.
I have a process.

Our final act
of kindness.

It's been an honor serving
the sanctity of life

with you all.

Hee-aaaaaaaaarghhhhhhhhh!

Rick, what are you doing?

Standing here
with you guys.

You don't want to do that.

We're sacrificing
ourselves here.

Then so am I. Y'know?

Elon Musk be damned,
we're blowing up Mars.

No.
We're doing something selfless.

You're doing it
out of pettiness.

How is anyone supposed
to know the difference?

Consider it a game
of virtue chicken.

Okay, if you won't go,
we'll make you go.

Oh. Sorry. I-I dino-proofed
my tech to spite you guys.

Which further proves
selflessness and selfishness

are two sides of the same coin,
so what's the point?

Fine. Cool with me
that your final chapter

is dying on Mars
with an old dickhead.

Hyaaaa!

Aaaah!

All right!
Welcome back.

You obnoxious little twat!

Yeah, but you're alive.

No David Foster Wallace-ing
in my galaxy.

You don't get to be
so smart

that you remove yourself
from everybody.

From one god being to another,
you're welcome.

Well, as long as we're doing
each other favors...

Hey. Wait, wait, wait.
What are you doing?

You fixed my rift?

You fucking hypocritical
cocks.

I-It was all canonical
and shit.

We coulda milked that thing
for a whole season.

O-Or, like, a three-episode arc
at least.

Sorry. That's just us.

We love helping,

god beings to god being.

Seriously.
I was gonna fix that.

Shit.
They're coming back.

Can we turn on the A.C.?

It's, like,
a thousand degrees outside.

Yes!
New follower.

Named...
CryptoForBareToes?

Not sure I get it,
but sounds like business.

Proud of you, honey.

Is Dad okay?

Yes.
I'm just...

writing my second book.

I don't know
what it's gonna be about,

but I can tell you
one thing -- The title is

"Jerry Smith Presents:
A Book by Jerry Smith."

Chapter one...

Fuck!

Morty, get your ass
in the garage!

Hoo-ha! Check it out.

A -- A dimension where
hats wear people.

Mmmmm! Oh!

I did it!
I fixed portal travel.

Oh, shit.

Figured my guy
deserves a vacation.

Boob World!
You're damn right.

And it's Areola Week.

All right!

Good old-fashioned
portal fun.

Yep. Like this.

Ohh! Whoa!

It's gonna be
classic episodes, Morty.

Oh, I'm gonna puke, Rick!
Portaling in.

Wrecking shit, portaling out,
Morty.

Oh, my Go--
Adventures, Morty.

Aah! Aah!
Social commentary.

Crude characters.
Here we go.

Rick and Morty time!

This is our home now.

We shall live out the rest
of our days here.

Never interfering with the ways
of the universe again.

We are content.

It was a good run.

Speaking of a good run...

I bet I could switch heel
onto that manny pad,

big spinout,
tre flip that gap, 5-0 the rail,

drop into the bowl,
stalefish into a Christ Air,

and then we get
fucking wrecked.

Ho-ho.
It's on, Iguanadon.

Grinding some rocks

Nollie the hubba

Goofy foot, kickflip,
take care of the groms

But you're
a bad little dino boy

And you're rotting
in a crater

So now let's make some noise

Did you get any of that?

Morty, be sure to pee
before we go.

This adventure is gonna be
a long haul,

and I don't feel like
emptying the jug.

Jerry, will you please just let
me automate this fucking task?

I didn't ask
for anyone's help.

You two
are welcome to leave.

Mom told me she wanted me
to stay here

to make sure
you didn't die.

Well, you tell your mother
that I'm gonna be fine.

Don't train your child
to lie, Jerry,

even though, you know,
'tis the season.

Then I'll tell her.

Whoa!

I told you,
no more rays.

What ray
did you zap me with?

I made your atomic matrix
slightly lighter than air,

and now your shoes
are heavier than air,

which makes you
neutrally buoyant,

which I find personally
more impressive conceptually

than walking on water,
but what do I know?

I wasn't born into
the god business.

I fucking earned it.

Whoa!

Just to be clear,
this doesn't mean you helped me.

It wears off in 10 hours,

and the next hit
will cost you 30 bucks.

Like I'll even be using it
in 10 hours.

Siri, set a 9-hour
and 50-minute timer.

Playing The Beatles.

I need to pee.
Nope.

Here, I've got a centipede
you can swallow

that makes you
not have to go.

I ain't swallowing
no centipede.

What, you think the centipede
wants to eat your pee?

You're not the victim
in this transaction.

Uh-oh, flat tire.

How the hell do you get
a flat tire in space, Rick?

Obviously from a sharp thing
in space, Morty.

It's just crazy
how much it feels

like getting
a regular flat.

Oh, no, no, that's just
my custom-programmed,

fully immersive flat-tire
indication experience.

I can turn it off.
I thought it was cooler

than the celebrity voice
package, but here.

Flat tire.
You should be... walkin'.

Oof.
Yeah.

Can I come out with you, Rick?No, I've seen this movie.

Two guys leave
the ship.

One guy
goes spinning away.

You're staying in here
where it's safe.

Morty, goddamn it.
Come on.

I n-- I never
get to be out here.

Ugh, you young people
think space is like

"Saturday Night Live."

You see it every day,
so you dream of being in it,

but it dreams of removing
all the air from your body

and making you float
around it for eternity

as a flash-mummified corpse,

which is also what space wants,
so get back in the car.

I'm not in danger.
There's nothing out here.

Literally everything
is out here,

and unlike everywhere else,
I'm too busy to help you.

Right, because you're
always so helpful.

Ah!

God damn it.
What is that?

Obviously,
it's a space snake.

T-There's snakes
in space?

There's literally everything
in space, Morty!

Now get the fuck
back in the car.

I'm dying, Rick.

I can see the black mountain.

People who are really dying
don't keep bring it up.

Is that true?
I don't know.

I'm just usually around people
that die faster.

All right. All right.

J-Just let me analyze
the snake's planet,

so I can whip up
an antivenom.

Computer, you might want
to put a rush on this.

Morty's starting to look
like a '90s Japanese ghost.

Cutting corners.

Oof, oh, my God,
these snakes are a mess.

19 billion snakes divided
into 10,000 nations

all on the brink
of global war over...

race.

How funny is that?

Imagine being
a racist snake.

"Hey, other snake,
I hate you

because you're
the wrong color, snake."

Oh, my God.
You're not laughing?

Oh, you're dying.

It's a miracle they were able
to fling one this far out

before they slithered
into extinction.

Oh, oh, God,
I killed their --

What's his name,
their Buzz Aspirin?

It's actually
Buzz Advil, Morty,

and, uh, this is
totally different.

It's a female snake.

There's an extra layer
of heartbreak.

Wait. Wait.
Morty, Morty, you hear that?

Listen.

Snake jazz.

Ha. Idiots.
Let's get moving.

We've got a long way to go,

and I'm not sharing
that centipede.

Rick, wait.
Go back.

I-I can't be the reason why
19 billion snakes lost all hope.

That's right, Morty.

Only 19 billion snakes
can do that.

That species was never
getting beyond this stage.

To paraphrase
the great Jeff Foxworthy,

if you bite your first contact
on its ankle,

you might be
a type-zero-civilization-neck."

What up, homeys?

Shooting hoops, I see.

Hey, who's interested
in a friendly bet

that this white guy
can jump.

Hey, leave the racial stuff
off the court, okay?

Oh, I thought that kind of
talk was part of street ball.

Well, now it's part
of everything else, so chill.

We -- We got off
on the wrong foot.

My name is Jerry Smith.
I live in the suburbs.

I'm only here because
I have a certain power

I wanted to kind of celebrate
before it goes away.

Yo, we got a Nazi
up here.

Hey, I think there's
a misunderstanding.

Here, just -- just watch.

Huh?

Help! Help!

I-I need that shoe!

No, no, don't touch that shoe
or that money.

Let them be a powerful
but confusing monument

to our
neighborhood's integrity.

Oh, boy, what an adventure,
huh?

Hey, Morty, listen.
I can tell you're pretty upset

about the whole
snake encounter thing,

so I'll tell you what.

I'm just gonna go ahead
and avoid you

for the rest of the day.

Play snake jazz.

I-Is this one friendly?

It's a snake.

You ever -- You ever see
this one look up at the sky

like it's dreaming
of something more?

No, but, uh, all those ones
marked with red sticker, yeah.

Any snake over 50 bucks
yearns for the beyond.

I-I-I've seen them do it.

Ow! Damn it, Slippy,
come on.

Ow!
Just please.

I'm sorry.

Everyone has a plumbus in their home.

First, they take the dinglepop.

Ow!
Fucking monster.

Downbeat.

How do you win
this fucking game?

We-We've never
gotten that far.

Guys, did I not tell you
to keep your eye on Jerry?

We did.Then where is he?

Maybe he's having
an affair.

But for real,
has anyone seen him?

Grandpa, did you trap him
in a painting again?

I didn't do shit.

Well,
y-y-you made him floaty.

- Asshole.
- Made him floaty?

I saved his life by making his
body slightly lighter than air,

and it expires
in a couple of hours.

Expires, like he'll fall
out of the sky?

He won't by in the sky,
Beth,

unless it's possible for Jerry
to fuck up wearing shoes.

Oh, crap, he's gonna die.
- What were you thinking?

Hey, babe.

Jerry,
are you in the air?

Rick told me
he made you floaty.

Made me floaty?
Pfft.

Got to love
Rick's world view.

Yes, I had Rick
make me floaty

so I could
put up some lights.

Now, I'm at
the light store.

Get away!

Sorry, this lady at the store
is trying to peck me.

Yes, you can help me find lights after I'm off the phone.

We're in Rick's ship.
How about we just pick you up?

You're with Rick?Well, why wouldn't I --

Jerry, I paused Beth
with a device

Christopher Walken gave me
after a record session.

Real talk, buddy,
where you at?

Go to hell, Rick. Come on, Jerry.

I can recognize
the sound of a seagull.

Can you recognize the sound
of a man's pants

filling up with rain?

I hope to one day.

Jerry,
I'll tell you what.

Because it's Christmas,
I'm gonna do you a favor.

I won't let you die,
and I won't tell Beth

that you almost
killed yourself.

Sounds like
a win-win to me. Come again?

If I survive,
it'll be without you,

and if I die,
it'll be on your ass.

Merry Christmas, bitch.

I am the Jesus Christ
of Christmas!

...I be with him?

We both care.

Whoa. Jerry. Yes, honey?

Let us
just come get you.

Beth, I am so touched

that you care for me this much,
but I'm fine,

and I just want to put up these
Christmas lights,

and
I will eat your world.

Honey,
my dad can hear you.

Got to go.

See you soon.

Okay.

Well, it sounds like
he's fine.

Yeah, I'm almost kind of
rooting for him this time.

One Diet Sprite Remix,
please,

and, uh, is anyone here
an Uber driver?

You can't bring
that boulder in here.

What?I said no boulders.

This ain't the lake, buddy.
- Drop the rock.

Well, it's kind of a --
a service boulder.

Yeah,
I float without it.

Big man
holding a big rock,

think you can
take me down?

No, obviously not.
You're huge.

- Then put it down.
- Put the boulder down!

If I put it down,
I'm going to float.

- Drop it!
- Put it down!

And frankly, your bar
has a lot of ceiling fans.

You think you're better than us?Drop the rock.

- Put it down.
- Okay, okay, okay.

Hey, whoa,
what the fuck!

Stop doing that.I told you this would happen.

Well, stop floating.

- Who said you could float here?
- I can't control it.

Aaaaaaaaaah!

And take your girlfriend
with you.

Summer,
how supes shook am I

about your playlisting
fleekness tonight?

You love it?
It's snake jazz.

My little brother got bit
by a snake in outer space

and killed it
with a hubcap,

and my grandpa had to scan
its planet's culture

for an antivenom,
and they found this.

It's my jam.

Seriously, my new thing now
is snake jazz.

Can you alter the course
of a species' evolution

like that
without repercussions?

Gee, I don't know,
Nancy.

Can you alter the course
of being a giant fucking nerd?

Sorry.

Also, later, we need to discuss
your clothing and your weight.

That's fair.

What the hell?

Target acquired.

Snakes!
Get back in the car!

Morty, enough with the --
Snakes!

Target acquired.

Aliens, I am a robot sent back
in time by the Snake Resistance

to protect you
from Serpacorp.

My appearance is designed to be
familiar and to put you at ease.

The ape child must be eliminated
to protect our timeline.

Morty,
what the hell did you do?

I was just trying to do
the right thing.

I took a living snake --

Get behind me.
I will protect --

Aaah!

Why -- Why are they
attacking us?

I-I-I helped them.

You gave them proof that
there was something bigger

and scarier to unite against,
you little idiot.

They would have gone back
into the Dark Ages

for a couple of generations,

but instead,
they dedicated themselves

into making
universe-destroying,

un-thought-out technology
like time travel

all so they could try to kill
a little shit sack on Earth

who couldn't let
a dead snake be dead

even after
it bit his ankle.

Next time,
stay in the fucking car.

17 billion snake lives
ended on June 21, 2026.

The survivors lived only to
face a new nightmare,

the war between
snake and machine.

In the end,
snake overcame machine

because of what
we couldn't predict --

that an alien, a child from
a distant star, would save us.

W-Where are we going?
W-What are we doing here, Rick?

We got to get the heart
of Snake Net.

Now, shut up,
and stay close.

Resistance is mouselike.

Whoa, hey, look.
That one's actually really cool.

Come here, little guy.

Ah, you little son of a bitch.

Come on, Morty.

Your brood
must be exterminated.

You will not kill her
or her brood.

- Must kill brood and mother.
- Get behind me.

Your brood will seed all life
on this planet.

- That doesn't make sense.
- That didn't make sense.

Hey, it's --
it's Slippy!

Keep up, shit bag.

Hi, you went directly to voicemail

because your number
is not in my phone.

Don't leave a message.

Hi, honey.

Uh, look. Morty told me
that you didn't think

I could hang lights
without killing myself.

Look, I want to be a strong man
for you, but the truth is --

The truth is, I'm coming home
with the best lights ever.

Oof.

Whoa,
feel that turbulence?

Nope, I'm on molly.

Give me some.
Ahh.

10 hours has expired.

Aaaah!

I don't suppose you guys
will take a bribe?

Ah!

Anyone else want legs?

God damn it.
Are you kidding me?

I thought there'd be
a time machine in here.

They're not even a quarter
of the way through making it.

I'm gonna have to invent it
for them.

I-I don't know snake math.

Ugh, I didn't want to have
to do this.

Fuck.
All right.

W-What's going on?
What are you doing?

I'm reminding myself to commit
even more to your fuck up.

Hey, assholes.

Fuck you.
Takes one to know one.

What the heck?

Hey, man, you -- you okay?You know what? Fuck you.

What? Screw you.
Here.

Come on.
Was it really that hard?

What do you think?
Come on, Morty.

Man, I-I-I wonder why
I had a black eye.

Morty, shut the fuck up
and put these on.

Okay,
so w-what are we doing?

That book has everything
they need

to create
snake time travel,

a-and they're getting it
in 1985, snake time.

Now, they're gonna do it so
early that it won't involve us,

and they're gonna be
even stupider with it.

Huh,
a-and then what?

We're removing ourselves
from this sloppy,

fucked up story
and letting snake time travel

eat its own tail.

Just have to keep my grip.

Jerry Smith, I am here
to save you.

What? I already told Rick
I don't want help.

I do not know Rick.

I was sent by a society
of human-snake hybrids...

Classic Rick...from an alternate
version --

I did it!
We're landing!

I knew I could do it.

Jesus Christ, Rick,
it's pandemonium out there!

T-This is worse
than when we left.

Rick, look, Summer!

Nobody chokes me
without consent.

Y-You just made things worse,
Rick.

Trust me, Morty.

We helped them press
on the gas pedal.

We just got to wait for them
to blow by a cop.

Shleemypants here,
what's up?

Snakes? Time travel?
They did what?

How the fuck did --
Okay, okay, I'm on it.

We got a 10-on a goddamn snake planet.

Don't look at me.
I'm afraid of snakes.

"I'm afraid of snakes,"
Bullshit.

You afraid of work.
That's what you afraid of.

All right.
All right.

Let's go
take care of this.

Oh, look at you.

You a smart snake,
huh?

You using tools now,
huh?

Those tools are gonna
turn into you

manipulating the fabric
of shit.

Get over here, mother fuckerWhat the fuck you think
you doing?

Don't fuck with time.You don't fuck with time.

Holy shitWhat happened?

Look, this is better
than them attacking us.

Also, that's about
as much curvature

as you're gonna get
from a time-travel story.

You know what? This one counts
as one of your adventures.

Hey, come on.
No freebies.

Aw, man, I-I wanted
to go to Boob World.

Well, now, we can't
because you fucked up.

Got to learn a lesson.

You want to go to Boob World,
Summer?

Eh, not today.

This sucks.

Hey, honey, check it out.

Jerry,
I was worried about you.

Oh, just killing some snakes
up here like everyone else,

I guess, and finishing
the Christmas lights.

Wait, the whole time?

I was screaming for help,
and you stayed on the roof?

I couldn't hear you
over my own screaming.

We've talked about this.

Well,
I'm just glad you're safe.

Well, duh,
of course, I'm safe.

Hey, guess what,
asshole.

I did it without you.

Whoa! Ah!

Oh, God, it hurts.

What was that?

I healed your leg 50%.

The rest is on you,
big man.

That's what I'm talking about.
Respect, my brother.

Geez, your dad sucks.
All right, Morty.

Let's go enjoy
a little bit of eggnog, huh?

All right.

Not so fast, boys.

Yeah, I think you might be
forgetting something.

Merry Christmas, fuck nuts.
Get to work.

Geez, I don't see why you have
to be smug about it.

- A bunch of bullshit
- That's not necessary.

This fucking sucks.

Yeah, it's fun until it's you,
huh, shit nog?

Yeah, have fun sewing those
snake costumes together,

you little tramp.
- You tell them, Morty.

Geez, you guys don't have
to be dicks about it, all right?

Yeah, neither did the guys
before us, but you know what?

They were.
Merry Christmas, you shit bags.

Yeah, ghost of Christmas future,
bitches, you fucking idiots.

So mean.
Those guys are mean.

Man, I just want to open
my Christmas presents.

Well, I'm waiting on you
to finish those snake costumes.

I'm almost done.
You know what?

T-They're good enough.
I'm done.

All right.
Let's go.

All right. We're landing.
Come on.

Man, I can't believe
we're almost done, Rick.

I can practically taste
the eggnog.

Hey, you know what?

I -- I feel like
we're forgetting something.

Oh, yeah, uh, thanks
for reminding me.

Morty, next time,
stay in the car.

Did you get any of that?

﻿[ POPPING ]

- [ SIGHS ]
- Hey, Rick.

I have to make a project for
the science fair this weekend.

You think you could help me out?

- Whatever.
- Well, I mean, traditionally...

science fairs are
a father-son thing.

Well, scientifically,
traditions are an idiot thing.

Morty, I think it would
be fun for you

to work on a science project
with your Dad.

[ CELLPHONE BEEPS ]

Uh...
[ CLEARS THROAT ]

Yeah, Dad.
Why don't we do it together?

Yes! You backed the right horse
on this one, son.

We'll get out the crayons,
brew some coffee,

and knock this thing out
in two or three days.

[ ROBOT WHIRS ]

[ MONOTONE ] What is my purpose?

Pass the butter.

Thank you.

[ POPPING ]

[ SIGHS ]

Dad, I need a ride to work.

Maybe Rick can give you a ride.

I'm helping Morty with science.

- I'm busy.
- Doing what?

Uh, anything else.

What is my purpose?

You pass butter.

Oh, my god.

Yeah, welcome to the club, pal.

Since when do you have a job?

Since last week.

It's part-time at this
little vintage thrift store.

My boss is this really
smart, eccentric old man

that treats me nice
and values me.

Meow.
Can't wait to meet...

this [BURPS]
fascinating character.

Please don't.

Oh. Well, when did this
stop being Jamba Juice?

I've just recently opened
for business,

Mister, um, Goldenfold.

You know my name?

[ CHUCKLING ] That's disarming.

I also know you long
for female company.

You know, it has been
lonely since the divorce.

Some voids can't be filled
with Jamba Juice.

This aftershave makes a
man quite irresistible to women.

Free of charge.

One never pays here...
not with money.

Nothing to read into
there. Thanks!

Sorry I'm late,
Mr. Needful.

This is my grandpa, Rick.
He was just leaving.

Huh.

Tell me, Rick,
what do you desire?

Eh, I make my own stuff.

So, what are you...
like, the devil?

- What? Sorry?
- I don't know.

Store comes out of nowhere,
all the shit's old and creepy.

Are you the devil?
A demon? Leprechaun?

- Grandpa Rick!
- Hey, I'm not judging.

Just like shoot straight.
I'm a man of science.

Ah, then perhaps you could
make use of this.

This microscope reveals things
beyond comprehension.

[ LAUGHS ]

[ RICK LAUGHS ]

[ LAUGHS LOUDER ]

[ RICK LAUGHS LOUDER ]

[ LAUGHS LOUDER ]

[ RICK LAUGHS LOUDER ]

[ LAUGHS LOUDER ]

Grandpa, go home and drink.

[ SWOOP! ]

Why don't we do a model
of the solar system?

That's what my Dad did with me
when I was your age.

Oh, okay.

You know, Rick's in his lab,
making cyborgs

and wormholes
and all that weird stuff,

but this is real science.

A man and his boy,
making planets.

Hey, how about we use
a ping-pong ball for Pluto?

And then Jupiter...

Uh, actually, I don't
think Pluto's a planet.

[ CHUCKLES ]

Of course Pluto's a planet, son.

I learned that
in the third grade.

Well, yeah, but you
know they changed it.

Morty, nobody changed
the planets.

I just googled it.
Pluto's not a planet.

They changed it in 2006.

Yeah, I heard about that, Morty.

And I disagree.
- You disagree?

That's right. It's possible
to disagree in science, Morty.

Pluto was a planet.

Some committee of
fancy assholes disagree.

I disagree back.
Give me a ping-pong ball.

Um, okay.
I-I just have to...

Go find Rick and go
over my head about Pluto?

No. Geez!

I just gotta go
to the bathroom. Damn.

Oh. [ COUGHS ]
Okay, good.

[ LAUGHING ]
This is gonna be fun.

[ ELECTRICITY CRACKLING ]

Hey, Morty, let me [BURPS]...
let me [BURPS]...

let me ask you a question
real quick.

Does evil exist, and if so,

can one detect and measure it?

- Um...
- Rhetorical question, Morty.

The answer's "yes, you just
have to be a genius."

Cute. Your sister's boss
gave me a microscope

that would have
made me retarded.

Ooh.
Oh, boy, Rick.

I'm don't think you're allowed
to say that word, you know?

Morty, I'm not disparaging
the differently abled.

I'm stating the fact that
if I had used this microscope,

it would have made me
mentally retarded.

Okay, yeah, but I don't think
it's about logic, Rick.

I think the word has just
become a symbolic issue for

powerful groups that are
doing the right thing.

Well, that's retarded.

- What are you talking about?
- Apparently, nothing.

You asked him if
Pluto's a planet, didn't you?

- No!
- It's not.

- Shut up, Rick.
- Whoa.

I don't care what anyone says.

If it can be a planet,
it can be a planet again.

Planet.
Planet, planet, planet.

Stay scientific, Jerry.

This aftershave made women
want me,

but it also made me impotent!

A price for everything,
Mr. Goldenfold.

A price for everything.

[ LAUGHS EVILLY ]

[ GASPS ] Oh, my god!

How could I not
see this coming?!

[ SOBBING ] My lust!

My greed!

I deserved this!

This serum should [BURPS]
counteract the negative effects.

Holy cats!
Ladies, let's get out of here.

[ DOOR OPENS ]
I haven't learned a thing!

Here. [BURPS]

You can have this [BURPS] back.

You didn't use it?

Sure I did...
to develop this.

It detects and catalogs
all your "Twilight Zone,"

Ray Bradbury,
"Friday the 13th" The Series

voodoo crap magic.

I thought you might
want it so you didn't

accidentally
sell anybody, say...

A typewriter that generates
best-selling murder mysteries

and then makes the murders
happen in real life?

Ooh.
- Be quiet.

Don't you want to make sure

people know what they're
getting?

You're not intentionally
selling...

Beauty cream that makes
ugly ladies pretty

but also makes them blind?

I find this all quite
preposterous.

Oh, I say, good sir.
Oh, harrumph.

Oh, oh [BABBLES]!

That's beautiful.

You know it's gonna be wearing
you in three hours?

[ DOOR OPENS ]
Do I need to call the police?

Here, you can use my phone.

Don't worry, it won't
make you deaf

because I'm not a hack.

Hey!

[ BOTH GRUNTING ]

You think you're fucking
so great!

Stop it! No!

Fuck yeah, man.

Stop it right now!

Grandpa Rick,
I like working here.

- You work for the devil.
- So what?

- BOTH: "So what?"
- Yes!

So what if he's the devil, Rick?

At least the devil has a job.

At least he's active
in the community.

What do you do?

You eat our food
and make gadgets.

Buh-bye.

Wh[BURPS]Oops.

[ GIGGLES ]

I'm sorry, Mr. Needful.
I'll clean that up.

I don't know what I can do
about the ghost lady

that came out of it, but...
- It's fine.

Summer, you know,
your grandfather's right.

This store curses people.
That's my business.

Well, yeah.
Fast-food gives people diabetes,

and clothing stores have
sweatshops.

Is there a company hiring
teenagers that isn't evil?

This is my first job.

You've been nice to me,
Mr. Needful.

You respect me.

Please, call me "The Devil."

I'd rather not, actually.

Yes, perhaps not during
business hours.

I told you, I want to
file a declaration

that Pluto is a planet.

Well, then my son's going to
fail his science class,

and when that happens,
I'm suing you first.

[ CLICKS ]

I think I know what the "A"
in N.A.S.A. stands for.

- Dad, what's your endgame?
- Ain't no game, sucka.

Why don't we just make the solar
system with eight planets?

It's even easier.

Sure, sure, and why don't we
just burn Galileo at the stake

for saying the sun is round?

Science isn't always easy,
Morty.

[ HUMMING ]

Whoa! Whoa!

What the hell?!

[ BOTH GROANING ]

[ TING! ]

[ HISSES, BUZZES ]

[ FANFARE PLAYS ]

I'm King Flippy Nips,
ruler of Pluto.

We discovered you quite
by accident

during routine surveillance
of your world.

You really gave it to those
guys at N.A.S.A.

I was... you know,

sometimes science is
about conviction.

It'd like to introduce you
to a few people

that very much agree with you.

Oh, I...

[ ECHOING ] Plutonians.

Jerry Smith is a scientist
from Earth,

where he's creating a model
of our solar system.

Jerry, tell Pluto
about your decision.

[ CLEARS THROAT ]

[ ECHOING ]
Um... Pluto's a planet.

[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]

Pluto's a fucking planet, bitch!

Oh, man. This is definitely
gonna go to his head.

If it's athletic prowess
you desire, Principal Vagina,

I might...
- I'll take it.

B-But I haven't even...

Thank you very, very much.

Great store.
Great place. Bye.

Huh. Okay.

I must say, Summer, I thought
your grandfather's outburst

would have disrupted business,

but this is the best weekend
I've had since Salem.

Nice. "Wholesome Delight"
for lunch?

- Is that the vegan place?
- Yeah, I love their soup.

I'm kind of soup-ed out.

[ DOOR OPENS ]
Mrs. Tate, is it?

What do you desire?

Whoa, whoa, slow down, honey.

Oh, is there a limit?
Everything's free, right?

Let's just say you
don't pay... with money.

[ BOTH CHUCKLE ]
That was perfect.

You pay with the curses, right?

Um... I... well...

But, Mrs. Tate, why do you
want cursed items?

Well, I'm going to get
the curses removed

at "Curse Purge Plus."

You know, the guy on TV?

[ DOOR CLOSES ] What?

Have you acquired
creepy specific old stuff

from a mysterious antique
or thrift store

that gives you powers
but fucks with you

in unforeseeable ways?

Bring it
to "Curse Purge Plus."

[BURPS] I use science to
UN-curse the items for cash,

and you get to keep the powers.

This guy got mysterious sneakers

to make him run faster,
but guess what?

He would have had to run
until he died,

making them worthless.

I removed the curse,
making them worth,

like, I don't know, $8 million.

See you at the Olympics.

This eerily intelligent doll

was threatening to murder
its family.

Now it does their taxes.

Everything's deductible.

Don't pay for cool stuff
with your soul.

Pay for it with money.

You know, like how every other
store in the world works?

We're located at First and Main
in Old Town.

Come on... come on down.

"First and..."

[ BABBLES ]

That's right across the street
from "Needful Things,"

where you can get evil items
for free!

Diabolic son of a motherf...

We're back on
"Good Morning, Pluto."

And a very good morning it is

for our guest,
Earth scientist Jerry Smith,

who's making headlines
with his bold announcement

that is what, Jerry?

Pluto is a planet.

[ CHUCKLING ]
Well, how about that.

I love it.
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]

Morty Smith.
I'm Scroopy Noopers.

I'm a scientist.
Can I show you something?

Uh, I better not.

Right now.

[ BLURP! ]

The center of Pluto,
Mr. Smith,

is made of a substance called
"plutonium."

mines like these suck plutonium
up to the cities,

where corporations use it
to power everything,

from diamond cars
to golden showers.

And the more we remove,
the more Pluto shrinks.

[ RUMBLES ] There it goes again.

Just shrank a little.

But a few years ago,

your scientists noticed Pluto
had gotten so small

they couldn't even call it
a "planet" anymore.

Should've been
our wake-up call.

But the rich plutonians
won't wake up,

and they love your Dad telling
everyone Pluto's a planet

because that means
they can keep mining

until Pluto goes
from planet to asteroid

to meteor, and finally...

poof.
- Um, a party?

Is everyone in your family
an idiot?

Well, for sure
me and my Dad are.

[ SIGHS ]
Well, all you have to do

is get him to admit that,

and you could save
four billion lives.

Yeah, you know, the thing is
my Dad's really insecure.

Hmm. Funny.

Mr. Needful, out of everything
in the store,

you'll never guess
what we couldn't get rid of.

[ GASPS ]
- [ SPUTTERING ]

Oh, my god.

[ GRUNTING ]

Oh, my god.

I wish this desk was lighter.

I wish this knot was looser.

[ GRUNTS ] Come on.

[ BLOWS ] I don't...

[ GRUNTS ]

Wait, what am I doing?

I wish I knew CPR.

1, 2, 3.

[ CHOKES, SPUTTERS ] Oh, Jesus.

What a waste of a monkey paw.

Mr. Needful, how
could you even think of doing

something so horrible?

I'm the devil.
What should I do

when I fail...
get myself an ice cream?

You haven't failed.

People like Rick
are making me obsolete.

I mean, seriously.
I may be "the devil,"

but your grandpa is the devil.

I just want to go back to hell,

where everyone thinks
I'm smart and funny.

No!
It's not fair.

Everyone in this town
got something they wanted

from you... even Rick.

I was your only friend,
and I get nothing?

Okay. I'll give you one thing.
Name it.

I want to help you.

Clever twist.

I learned from
the best, you old fart.

Now, let's go get you hydrated.

Looks like we've got...

haunted boxing gloves
that will make you

the heavyweight champion
in 1936,

and then you'll be
trapped there,

winning the same fight
for eternity.

I can take out the "eternity"
and the padding,

and then you'll have some
time-traveling mittens.

Oh, look, it's Rosemary's Baby.

How's business?

Here's the last
of our inventory.

We're going to file chapter 1 and do some restructuring.

Sounds like code for
"You win, Rick."

That was important
to you, wasn't it?

Nope. Lt was important
to your dumb devil friend.

To me, this was all just a bit,

like when Bugs Bunny fucks
with the opera singer

for 20 minutes.

He tried to kill himself.

[ LAUGHING ]
Seriously? Holy crap.

Holy crap.

But you know what, Grandpa Rick?

He's strong, and he's never
going to give up.

- Uh-huh, yeah, I don't care.
- Oh, I know.

- Everyone knows you don't care.
- So?

So have fun not caring.

- I always do.
- Good.

Yeah, it is good.
[BURPS] It's the best.

I'm sure it is.

- Bye.
- Later.

I'm here to pick up
my undead cat and child.

Yeah, uh...
give me a sec.

These are the forms
for the employee health plan.

All right, yeah, put...
put them on my... eh.

I just got bored.

Everybody out.

JERRY:
All right, just one more rally,

then I promise we'll get back
to your science project.

Dad, Pluto isn't a planet.

It's shrinking because
of corporations.

Yeah, that's what that
anti-planet nut job

Scroopy Noopers was
screaming about

outside the Ministry of Money's
Fundraiser.

Are you telling me four billion
Plutonians are wrong?

You said science wasn't easy.

I said science
isn't a/ways easy.

Obviously, that means
sometimes it is easy.

Let's not debase ourselves
with word games, son.

Dad, their whole
planet is dying.

Ha! You called it a planet.
Checkmate.

What's up, Pluto?

[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]

[ CLASSICAL MUSIC PLAYS ]

Mr. Smith, please tell
my friend here

what you just told me.
Go on.

My very eager mother
just served us nine pickles,

and the "pickles" is Pluto.

[ SPUTTERS ]
My god, the man's a genius.

Um, excuse me.

Morty, what?

Dad, what did you
think about the recent report

published by
The Pluto Science Reader

linking Pluto-quakes, sinkholes,
and surface shrinkage

to deep-core plutonium
drilling?

Well, son, what did you think

when you were five
and you pooped your pants,

and you threw your poopy undies
out your bedroom window

because you thought it was like

throwing something
in the garbage?

[ LAUGHTER ]

I mean, I'm trimming the hedges,

and these things are just
hanging there.

Was I supposed to think
the poop bunny left them?

Good one, Dad.

Hey, Morty, you want to
go on a... oh.

Hey, Beth.
Hello?

Hey, Jerry, you in here
being stupid?

[ SIGHS, BURPS ]

[ ROBOT WHIRS ]

Thanks.

Hey, you know, I was thinking,
you know,

I might watch a movie.

I am not programmed for
friendship.

Suit yourself.
[ BURPS ]

[ HUMS ]

Hey.
[CLEARS THROAT] Hey.

W-W-What's going on?

Um, can you help me do
the stupid science fair project?

Whatever.

PLUTONIAN:
Jerry, you must be so excited.

The Pluto-bel prize is
the highest honor

a scientist can receive.

I'm flattered and humbled.

Oh, I like that.
Use that in your speech.

Also, talk about Pluto
being a planet.

People like that.

Your highness, we've captured
Scroopy Noopers.

You animals! Animals!

Ooh, look who's little
journey's come to an end.

Take him to Pluto-namo Bay.

You can't kill the truth,
father.

- What?
- I can see you're confused.

Pluto-namo Bay is
a military prison...

a sort of play on words.

Did he call you "father"?

Scroopy Noopers,
the anti-planet nutjob,

is your son?

The young eat the old
if you let them, Jerry.

Pluto is a cold, cold
celestial dwarf.

- It's a what?
- Huh? Oh, planet.

[ LAUGHS ]

"Pluto is a cold,
cold planet."

That's what I meant.

Knock them dead out there, you.

[ ECHOING ] Pluto is...

[ SIGHS ] not a planet.

- [ SHOUTING ]
- Ow! It's not a planet.

Hey!
It's not a planet!

I'm an idiot, and I love my son.

It was a long six hours,

but we've overhauled
"Needful Things"

into the globally-compliant
web 4.
"E-nomenon," n33dful.Com,

spelled with threes
instead of "E's."

[ CHEERING ]

Okay, that's it.
We just got bought by Google!

Mm.
I'm so proud of you, Lucius.

So, how much did we make?

[ CHUCKLING ]
"We."

This is my business.
Security!

[ GASPS ]
You're Zuckerberg-ING me?

I was Zuckerberg-ING people

before Zuckerberg's balls
dropped.

I'm the devil, bitch!
What, what?!

[ FIDDLE PLAYS ]

Hey!
[ GROANS ]

- Hey, Morty.
- Oh, oh, hey, Dad.

Um, what... what are you doing
back from Pluto so quick?

Uh... some people just
can't handle the truth.

Especially dummies like me.

Morty, I'm not as smart
as your grandpa Rick,

but I promise never to make
that your problem again.

Hey, Dad.

Nobody's smarter than Rick,
but nobody else is my Dad.

You're a genius at that.

Wow.
[ SNIFFLES ]

That's... humbling
and flattering, son.

Thank you.

What say we finish ourselves
an eight-planet solar system?

Um... I'm just gonna
take this thing in

and get an "A."
- Butter.

- But...
- You're a genius...

at being my Dad, Dad.

Quit while you're ahead.

And also, knock next time,
you know?

I mean, I'm sitting in here,
I'm 14...

I got a computer in here,
you know?

Oh, I... I think
I understand.

You're really playing with fire

when you burst in here
like that, man.

I get it. Say no more.

I mean, one of these days,

you know, you're gonna end
up seeing something.

I got it!
Noted. Good night.

[ METAL MUSIC PLAYING ]

How's your pretend
grandpa doing, aka "The Devil"?

- He dumped me.
- Oof. Sorry.

Did we learn a lesson here
I'm not seeing?

Not sure.

Maybe in a much bigger way,

Mr. Needful gave us
both what we really wanted?

Because I was always jealous of
you hanging out with Morty,

and you didn't realize how much
you valued my approval?

- No, that's dumb.
- Yeah, not satisfying.

I'll tell you what, though.

If... if... if it's satisfaction
you're after,

I think I might have an idea.

[ WHISPERING ]
- Uh-huh.

Uh-huh.

Uh-huh, totally.
Let's do it.

[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]

Rick? Summer?

[ AUDIENCE GROANS ]

Stupid motherfucker!

You stupid bitch.

Stupid motherfucker!

How do you like that?
How do you like that?

[ GRUNTS, GROANS ]

W-W-Why?

Because sometimes
what you really need is

for someone else to pay
a horrible price.

[ WHIMPERS ]

[ SPITS ]

- We did it.
- Yeah, bro.

We totally worked it.
We did it!

We just pulled it off.

Yeah, bro.
Yeah.

﻿- SUMMER: Bye, mom! Bye, Dad!
- MORTY: Drive carefully!

Have fun, you two.

Yes, we will have as
much fun as possible on our...

Titanic-themed getaway.

Let's lose the 'tude, please.

It's supposed to be romantic.

Speaking of disasters, Dad,
we are leaving you in charge.

I know, c-can we wrap
this up?

Morty and I [BURPS] have some
synthetic laser eels

oxidizing in the garage.

Hey, don't blow me off.

I am drawing a line, okay?

Any damage to this house
or these children

when we get back, and...

n-no more
adventures with Morty.

Aw, geez, Rick, if my mom's
the one saying it,

then you know it's pretty
serious this time.

- BOTH: That's right.
- Wait. What?

Listen, you have
my word as a caregiver,

everything's gonna be fine.

And if not, like you say, no
more adventures or whatever.

It's like that old song

"Blomp Blomp-a Noop Noop
A-Noop Noop Noop."

Y-You guys know that song?
From Tiny Rogerts?

You never heard of it?

You know, the black effeminate
guy from the '50s?

No-Nobody?

A-All right, whatever.
Look, who cares?

Just go on your stupid trip.

Not one thing out of place.

[ ENGINE TURNS OVER ]

Not a single thing.

[ BUBBLING, CRACKLING ]

Well, we're past
the point of no return.

I'm going to have a party.

SUMMER: I found jello. Can you
sneak your mom's vodka?

Yes, she does.
I saw it in your laundry room.

Listen, you can't both be
in denial about it.

Okay, bye.
- Summer!

You can't throw a party!
Remember what mom said?

Yeah, if anything
gets messed up,

you and Grandpa Rick get
punished.

I'm only a human being, Morty.

Rick, tell Summer
she can't have a party!

Uh, Summer, you can't
have a party.

- [ SCOFFS ]
- Because [BURPS]

I'm having
a party, b-i-i-i-itch!

Oh, what?!
Rick, you can't!

What do you mean
you're having a party?

Are some Glip Glops
from the third dimension

going to come over
and play cards or something?

"Glip Glop?"

You're lucky a Traflorkian
doesn't hear you say that.

Is that like their
N-word?

It's like the N-word
and the C-word had a baby

and it was raised by
all the bad words for Jews.

Listen, I think the
three of us could just,

you know, have a nice
time, like, just hanging out,

and, you know, doing
a little bonding and...

Screw that.
This is my chance...

to gain some footing
with the cool kids.

That's why you party?
Boy, you really are 17.

- Why do you party?
- To get [BURPS]...

wr-wriggedy
wriggedy wrecked, son!

Just keep your sci-fi friends
away from my awesome ones.

Yeah, and you keep your
awesome friends away

from my canapes.

After dinner, Titanic2will
attach to the rail system

near our replica iceberg,

and the hydraulics
encased in these tubes

will execute a controlled sink
into the icy depths.

A rail system seems archaic

for an attraction this
impressive.

Are you sure the ship will sink?

I can assure you the ship
will sink,

as it has a thousand
times before.

It is UN-unsinkable.
- Ooh!

Look, it's the line for the bow!

Jerry, I'd love to just
kick back

with a margarita and read.

Do you mind if I skip the whole
"King of the World" bit?

Well, it's not
the "King of the World" bit.

That's Jack and Fabrizio.

This is where Rose says,
"I'm flying, Jack!"

But whatever.

I can be the only one
to do it alone.

Well, what about her?
Excuse me, ma'am.

Would you like to take
my place in line?

I, uh... I could get
into trouble.

We won't tell.

So...
you're a Titanic fanatic?

Oh, yes. I've worked here
since it opened,

but I've never been able
to participate.

Happy to help... Rose.

[ GIGGLES ]

I love watching bukkake.

I mean, like, I don't know if I
personally would ever do it...

- Brad! Hey!
- Yo.

Brad is here! Quick, make
my hair look drunk.

Check it out.
Tammy's already drunk.

Cool.

The beacon was activated.

Who is in danger?
- Ugh! Grandpa!

Birdperson!

I am pleased there is
no emergency.

Oh, there's an emergency,
all right.

A pussy emergency!

When's the last time
you got laid, 'Pers?

It has been a... challenging
mating season for Birdperson.

Then it's time to get
your beak wet tonight, player.

Go have some fun out there
Birdp... Bird... Birdperson.

Oh, man, how many
people did you invite, Rick?

Uh... people?
Mm, six.

Yo! What up,
my Glip Glops?!

Oh, man!

[ ELECTRONIC MUSIC PLAYS ]

[ BREATHING HEAVILY ] Oh!

Y-Y-You know there's
a garbage, right?

Hey, uh, what the hell?!

Ooh. That's why you never
invite a Floopy Doop

and a Shmoopy Doop
to the same party.

[ BED SPRINGS SQUEAKING ]

Oh, oh, g...
oh, that's disgusting!

You guys are in my parents' bed!

Oh. Sorry.
I'm not feeling too well.

I just needed to lie down
for a bit.

Oh. Okay. S-S-Sorry.
[ CHUCKLES ]

[ GROANS ]

Oh, my god!
Are you kidding me?!

The thing people don't
realize about the gear wars

is that it was never really
about the gears at all.

Uh-huh. Yeah.
No, no, to-totally.

Rick, you gotta stop...

Morty!
Have you met Gearhead?

- Hey, how's...
- Morty here, he...

he would love to hear
all about the Gear Wars.

How familiar are you
with the gear wars, exactly?

Uh... not at all.

Oh, boy.
I envy you.

Okay, it was about
754 years ago...

Oh, hey, Morty! H-Have you met
my buddy Scropon?

Not again, Rick.

That last guy droned on for
20 minutes, you know?

And meanwhile, the whole house
is being destroyed!

Whoa, Morty, this guy's
entire planet was destroyed.

Have a little perspective.

Hey, Rick, squanchy party, bro!

Aw! Squanchy!

Is there a good place for me
to squanch around here?

Squanchy, you can
squanch wherever you want, man.

Mi casa es su casa, dawg!

All right!
I like your squanch!

Uh, Rick, what exactly
is "squanching"?

Morty, listen...
we've had a lot

of really cool adventures
over the last year,

but it's time to relax.

Yeah, if I relax now,
there might not

even be any more adventures!

Jesus, Morty, you're
bumming me out.

Can't we just pretend like
everything's fine

for a few hours,
enjoy ourselves,

and then worry
about all this later?

Yeah, that's easy
for you to say, Rick.

You know, you like not
caring about stuff.

You know, wh-wh-what's
in this for me?

[ SOFT MUSIC PLAYS ]

[ INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS ]

Jessica.

Knock it off, Slow Mobius!

Ha ha! Sorry, dude!

I'm just trying to show off
my powers, bro!

I can't believe she's here.

Well, what are you
doing standing here, Morty?

Go. Talk to her.

Tonight, the only adventure
you're on

is your cusping manhood.

[ BOTH LAUGH ]

Oh, Rose.

Whee!

Is that what I think it is?

Yes, every couple gets
to re-create Jack's drowning

at the end of the movie.

It's so romantic.

I can't wait to do
that with Beth.

I don't know, Jerry.
With all due respect...

it seems like your wife
may not be that interested.

[ GASPS ] Look!

Iceberg, right ahead!
The buffet is now closed.

Uh, sir?
There's not a problem.

What do you mean
there's not a problem?

The guidance system
isn't putting us

on a direct collision course.

This ship is about to completely
miss the giant iceberg!

Well, do something!
Steer into it!

I'm trying!

It's too late.
Ladies and gentlemen...

don't brace yourselves.

- [ ALL GASPING ]
- JERRY: No! What happened?!

WOMAN:
Their rail system must have failed.

[ INDISTINCT MURMURING ]

Totally gonna get laid tonight.

I like your feathers.

They are designed to attract
the attention of the female.

It's working.

Tammy, I should let you know

I just got out of a highly
intense soul bond

with my previous spirit mate.

I'm not looking to get
into a soul bond.

I'm just looking for...

I believe Birdperson can
arrange that.

Hey, Summer, haven't seen you
at flute practice in a while.

Summer, don't tell me
you're friends with her.

Are you kidding me?

I don't even know
what she's doing here.

Whoa. Not cool, Summer.
This is a party.

Everybody should be welcome.

[ CRASHES ]

Oh, great. Who invited
Abradolph Lincoler?

I thought everyone was welcome.

It's not the same, Summer.

Lincoler is a crazed maniac...

just a misguided effort
of mine to create

a morally neutral
superleader by combining

the DNA of Adolf Hitler
and Abraham Lincoln.

Turns out it [BURPS] just adds
up to a lame, weird loser.

Rick, you brought me
into this world,

a suffering abomination

tortured by the duality
of its being.

But I shall finally know peace

when I watch the life drain
from your wretched body!

Whoa. What's up, man?

I have no quarrel with you, boy.

"Boy"?
What's that supposed to mean?

It's just... l-look,

I-I don't know how you thought
I meant it, but...

Don't look at me, dude.

Look, I'm
half-Abraham Lincoln, so...

So I should get on my knees
and kiss your ass?!

Well, no, but...

You know?
- What do I know?

That the Third Reich will reign
for a thousand years?

- Leave him alone, Brad.
- Stay out of this, Jessica!

Kick his ass, Brad!
Kick his ass!

ALL:
Kick his ass! Kick his ass!

Brad!

Stupid!
[ GRUNTS ]

Rick!

I just did you a favor, Morty.

Sorry about all that.

Rick has some really
strange friends.

Ugh! Brad is such a jerk.

He's always trying to prove
what a man he is.

I just want to find somebody
nice and sweet.

Jessica, can I show
you something?

- Wow! Look at all this stuff.
- Yeah.

This is me and my grandpa Rick's
sci-fi workshop.

Check this out.

[ PROJECTOR BEEPING ]

It's beautiful.

You know, Jessica,
there's something

I've always wanted to tell you.

- What's that, Morty?
- I think you're the most...

No, that...
those weird sounds

coming from the closet
over there.

[ CLOSET RATTLING ]

- Oh, my god!
- Aah!

Hey, I'm squanching in here!

Oh, my god!
Oh, that is so disgusting!

if it weren't for the fact

that everyone's still
having a blast in there,

I would be so furious
with you right now.

Oh, man.
Y-You hear that, Morty?

You really lucked out
with Summer o-on that one.

How are you guys not
freaking out right now?!

T-The whole house is sitting
in another dimension!

I-I mean, w-what the hell
are we supposed to do?!

M-M-Mom and Dad are gonna
kill us!

I'm losing it here, Rick!
- Relax, Morty, relax!

It's gonna be fine.

All we have to do is go out
and find us

some Kalaxian crystals.

[ DETECTOR BEEPING ]
Oh, shit, motherfucker!

Kalaxian crystals, Morty,

just a few miles south of here.

Okay. Let's go, then.

W-W-We got to go get those
crystals right now, Rick.

Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Morty, l-I can't go with you.

I got to hang back

and make sure everything stays
cool here, you know?

I mean, who knows what... what
if somebody breaks something?

Yeah. Me too.
I should stay.

You guys have any aspirin?

Oh, hey, Morty, this is perfect!

You can take Lincoler with you.

Hey, I'm not going anywhere.
I'm injured.

Shut up, Lincoler.

It's the least you can do
for wrecking the living room.

Yeah! And, Nancy,
you should go, too.

What? Why... why me?

Because, uh, you're...

you're so good
at playing the flute.

CAPTAIN:
Sorry for the inconvenience, folks.

We should resume sinking shortly.

In the meantime, please,
stay on the ship

and enjoy a complimentary plate
of James Cameronion rings.

Great. Not only is
the ship not sinking,

but now the fourth wall
has been broken.

[ SIGHS ] I am gonna go back
to the room to finish my book.

You should find that Lucy woman.

But... but...

[ CLEARS THROAT ]
You see, Jerry?

May I show you something?

Had everything gone as planned,

this entire area
would be underwater.

[ SIGHS ]
I would have liked to see it.

This trip has been a "Titanic"
failure.

Get it?
Ooh!

- Draw me, Jerry.
- Oh, boy.

Lucy, wow.

Uh, this isn't
what I had in mind.

But it's the perfect moment.

We've been dreaming
about this for 16 years.

Um, not like this.
Not... not with you.

[ CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY ]

[ GUN COCKS ]
You are gonna draw me.

Then you're going to fuck
me in that car over there.

It's weird,
'cause I definitely think

that all men are created equal.

But, at the same time...
- Okay!

Um, the crystals should be
really close.

There they are!

Wait.

and that he loves you

Plumbuses.

Everyone has a plumbus
in their home.

and they smooth it out

The schleem is then repurposed
for later batches.

They take the dinglebop,

and they push it
through the grumbo,

where the fleeb
is rubbed against it.

It's important that the fleeb
is rubbed

because the fleeb
has all of the fleeb juice.

Then a schlami shows up,

and he rubs it and spits on it.

They cut the fleeb.

There's several hizards
in the way.

against the chumbles.

are shaved away.

Ohh, tune in next week...

[ THEME MUSIC PLAYS ]

To the best show ever,

the show we all grew and love...

"The Personal Space Show."

ANNOUNCER: More "Personal Space"
next Tuesday at 8:00.

Up next, the heat is turning up

with Samantha and the Boys
on "The Northsiders."

[ SPEAKING ALIEN LANGUAGE ]

[ WHISTLE BLOWS ]

If you could all just stop
screaming and chanting

and making whatever
that gesture means...

Excuse me. Come on.

Please, everyone, I have news
about Shrimply Pibbles.

Word of Jerry Smith

trying to weasel out
of his penis donation

has spread across the galaxy.

Beings everywhere
have come together

to offer what little they have
to help save Shrimply's life.

Enough to pay for a brand-new,
state-of-the-art synthetic heart

that will be even better
than Mr. Smith's pathetic penis.

Wait! That was an option
the whole time?!

You guys suck!

Yeah. We suck.
Are you still here?

Okay, Jerry. Let's head home.

I can't leave now.
Everyone hates me.

Unfortunately,
there's no surgical procedure

that can fix that.

Or is there?

[ MONITOR BEEPING ]

- Scalpel.
- Scalpel.

- Nano-Doctor.
- Nano-Doctor.

- Nano-Scalpel.
- Nano-Scalpel.

Okay. We're ready.

Not so fast!

Mr. Smith? What are you doing?
Are you insane?!

I'm a good person,

and I demand
that you cut off my penis

and put it in that man's chest.

That's not how it works!

Well, you're gonna make it work.

[ KNOCKING ]

I'm Octopus Man! [ LAUGHS ]

I'm Octopus Man! [ LAUGHS ]

I'm a marine biologist
who was bitten by an octopus.

[ LAUGHS ]

And now I'm... I help people.

I save people.

I'm a troublesome
octopus person.

Uh-Oh. I gotta save some trouble

'cause here comes
a trouble mite.

SUMMER: Gross!

Does all interdimensional TV
have to rely on juvenile violence?

Well, Summer, maybe people that
create things aren't

concerned with your delicate
sensibilities, you know?

Maybe the species
that communicate with each other

through the filter
of your comfort

are less evolved than
the ones that just communicate!

Maybe your problems
are your own to deal with,

and maybe the public giving
a shit about your feelings

is a one-way ticket
to extinction!

Geez, Morty.

I take it Cathrine Hefflefinger
hasn't texted you back yet.

I don't want to talk about it.

- Okay, guys, let's go home.
- Where's Dad?

Breaking news...
Shrimply Pibbles is being

held hostage by the human
known as Jerry Smith.

- Remove my penis!
- SUMMER: [ GASPS ]

- Holy crap!
- It's cool. It's fine.

It's gotta be from
an alternate reality, right?

- Are you sure?
- I don't know.

Do it! Do it! Remove my penis!

Sir, put the gun down

and step away from Mr. Pibbles!

- Jerry!
- Dad, what are you doing?!

I'm a good person.
I'm a good person.

Where did he get a gun?
Who gave him a gun?

That's not a gun.
That's the XP-20 XS.

Ah!

Oh, my god.

I'm a good person.

No!

Nooooo!

[ BOTH SCREAMING ]

MAN: Hey, how's it going?

This is
my butthole ice cream parlor.

I got all kinds of ice cream...
Peanut butter and jelly...

[ FARTS ] - ...vanilla...

[ FARTS ] - ...chocolate...

[ FARTS ] - ...and every flavor

served out of a butthole...

- [ GROANING ]
- just like you're back home.

- Dad!
- Dad!

What happened? Where am I?

Was it all a dream?

No, you were shot like 50 times.

57. Thankfully,
you're in a super-sophisticated

alien hospital,

so it was basically like
getting a splinter removed.

All... All I wanted
was for everyone to like me.

Jerry, remember that time
you left a comment

underneath that YouTube video
and someone replied

and called you a dumbass,
so you replied and told them,

"it takes one to know one,"
and you stayed up all night

hitting "refresh"
on your browser

waiting for them to reply
and then you fell asleep crying?

I remember it differently.

This is like that.
You can't make people like you.

You just have to wait
for hating you to bore them.

You know, you're right.

I shouldn't be motivated

by other people's
opinions of me.

All right, guys, let's go home.

If it's all the same
to you, Rick,

I'd like to go to the zoo...

- With my family.
- What?!

- What are you talking about?!
- Why would we do that?!

It's a stupid idea!
What's the matter with you!?

Don't be a piece of shit, Jerry!

Okay, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
We'll go home.

What the hell
is he talking about?!

♪♪

- Aah!
- I'm the Eyehole Man!

What is going on? Aah!

Give me my Eyeholes!
I'm Eyehole Man!

That part of the cupboard
is mine, Jerry!

Why do you even have those?!

- Give me my Eyeholes!
- Help me, please!

Get up on out of here
with my Eyeholes!

[ SCREAMING ]

Did you get any of that?

It's-a good-a show!

﻿Oh, my God, I cannot fucking
believe this!

Here we fucking go!

Oh! Jeez!

Pardon the interruption.

We are once again
in the federal clear.

Rick, what the hell?!
A-Are you a Turkey Dracula now?

Morty, is that
a Pooplickian GamePod?

Actually it's
the GamePod XL.

They say it's the most realistic
video game console ever.

-I never got you that.
-Space Mom did.

She's in for the holiday
weekend, remember?

Shit, in that case, let's go,
let's get out of here --

I heard you smack
the glass, Dad.

If you bail,
I'll disown you!

Yeah, I'd say don't
hop through a portal.

But, oh, wait, you can't.

Look at it this way, Morty.

Life is a subscription,
and Thanksgiving

is your family's
yearly charge.

Wow, Dad, good job.

Rick, put some pants on.

Today has so few rules.

Yes, Patriarch.

Ding ding ding!

I'd like to make a toast.

Today is a day for thanks.

And for family.

And for remembering
all of those that have less.

Okay, pick a scope.
Pick a scope?

Can we please have
a normal Thanksgiving?

Well, seems like all the ones
I remember.

Good point.

Baby, you --
It's a toast.

Sorry!
Sorry!

Anyway, I'm thankful
for my wife.

Beth.
The Beth that chose me.

I'm so grateful to you,

and I literally could
not live without you.

Aw!
Aw!Aw!

I really mean that.

If something were
to happen to you,

or if you were to leave me,
or be unfaithful,

I would die.
Mm!Uh...

Literally.
Probably by my own hand.

Eww.
Okay.

I know how I'd do it.

Our first blender has
an extra long cord

and it was manufactured
before safety fuses,

so I'd draw a warm bath --

And blend some stuff.
Good toast, honey.

To thankfulness.

To...
A-America?

To ending the toast?

To ending the toast!

Just to, uh, be clear,
I was saying I'd kill myself.

Jerry.God!
We know!

Sorry Jerry got
all husbandy.

Yeah, do not miss that.

So I was thinking we could set
you up in Jerry's man cave?

Oh, that's okay,
I'll sleep in my car.

It's got a TARDIS thing
going on, bigger on the inside.

Dad calls it hack, but my
soaking tub begs to differ.

Hmm, maybe I'll trade you.
Ohh!

Agh!
My lower back.

Oh, I got this.

Ah, Jesus,
that was great.

Well, you're me.

I find this is usually
the biggest help.

Mmm, oh, I just love...

the Venusian stuff.

It's cool, I get insecure trying
to pronounce this crap, too,

but I got just
the thing for that.

Here.

Um...

Okay, shoot that asteroid.
Now shoot that one.

Now shoot me in the face.
This game's trash.

I didn't want to say anything,
but this does seem lame.

Yeah, I thought it was maybe

'cause we've shot
so many real asteroids.

L-Let's look at the menu.

Oh! T-There's the realism
setting.

Oh, cool.
Also stupid.

The factory setting is 4?
What do we want, 10?

No, do 9.
I'm kidding.

Shut up, Summer.
Yeah, shut up, Summer.

Put 10.

This is the same.
It's worse. It's --

Oh. Oh.
I get it. Okay.

It's -- It's more real.

The vast majority of space
is empty.

What?
Who cares?

T-Then what am I doing?

Looks like you can record
a video for your kid

in case you die.

Not a bad idea, you're gonna be
in space for a while.

May as well.

Um, hey, son.
Uh...

If you're seeing this, I...

starved to death
while looking for an asteroid.

Ugh.
This is stupid.

You guys are obviously just
trying to convince yourselves

it's cool because
you feel lame about it.

Summer you know nothing
about gamer culture.

Bro, tell your son you love
the shit out of him.

Oh, I'm gonna!

Of course we both can't sleep
at the same time.

Yeah, we do share
a shitty back.

Turn around.
At least let me --

Yes, please.

Oh, my God.

Okay, I know we're not massage
people but you need this.

See, you act like this
badass space cowboy,

but I know you're just
a scared little overachiever

that keeps all her
OCD right --

Oh, my God!
Yeah.

By the way you better
be taking notes -- I'm next.

It's my back,
you dumb bitch.

Nice.

What?

Well, I better
get back to bed.

Yep. Same.

Oh, so now you're into
highly realistic video games?

Maybe I decided real life
was too much right now,

or maybe I'm not afraid
to change my mind about stuff.

Maybe mental flexibility
is stronger than stubbornness.

Nice manip', Sum-Sum.

Okay, I-I'm in the alley
behind the library.

-Uptown or downtown?
-Shit, there's one uptown, too?

It's okay, stay there,
I think I'm near the red line.

Is this "Street Fighter"?

"Street Fighter"
where you start

at the beginning
of each fighter's day

and have to find
each other to fight.

It's very realistic.

Not even guaranteed
a fight will happen.

That meter filling up is us
forgetting what made us so mad.

If anyone's interested
in a higher level of realism,

I'm booting up the OG --

that's Original Game,
called a jigsaw puzzle --

in the den.

Hey, gang!

Me and my space self
are gonna make a run

to the Gloppy Drop System
for ice cream.

Any flavor requests?

-Vanilla!
-Vanilla!

Why do you guys have to go

all the way to deep space
just for ice cream?

Gloppy Dropulites have less
taste buds than humans.

Their ice cream
is like a hospital bed.

It's designed for you
to do less so it does more.

Okay, see ya in a bit.

I'll get started sorting
all the obvious sky pieces.

Secret technique.

-Oh, shit, there you are!
-Oh, fuck, it's on, bitch!

I'm gonna eat your ass!
You will die in the street
like a dog!

Stunning.

Thank you.
This is incredible.

Eh. Just glad I had something
in your size.

How far is Gloppy Drop?

And why do I always think
I'm wearing a watch?

I actually have a pint
of Gloppy Drop

on a little apartment
orbiting Earth.

So we have time.

You have your own
space station?

We have our own
space station.

We're the same person.
There's differences.

Like, one of us has no idea
who she really is.

Wrong.
But let's make a deal.

Let's trust ourselves enough
to stop wondering

who we are
when we're together.

We get to say anything
to each other.

Things we'd never say
to anyone else, even ourselves.

What don't we say
to ourselves?

How about, "Wow, my ass looks
good in that space suit"?

I mean it.
I'm a good-looking woman.

Well, that's nice
of you to say.

I also...

find myself...

quite attractive.

We forgot the ice cream.

I want you back
in my guts like

I'm one of your sick
little fillies.

Oh, God damn it, Morty!

You can't just
take my controller

Yes, I can!
It's mine!

Ugh.
Okay, Sum-Sum, gimme.

Make your own controller,
some of us need

all the control we can get.

Ugh, fuck you!

So why are you so suddenly
into realistic video games?

I already was.

Yeah, but now you're into them
the way I am.

You mean, like staring at them
in a numb trance?

Uh-huh.
Not judging, just noticing.

Yeah, y-you tend to notice
stuff a little before I do.

But eventually
you do notice.

And now we can both
not notice together, yes.

Oh, my god -- Beth!

I thought you said
you got ice cream?

Yeah, I, uh --
It must be in the, uh...

Oh, the car!
We left it in the car.

Okay, good, because that
would have been weird!

I worry things might become
more and more noticeable.

Yeah,
and if he kills himself,

we're gonna have to get
a new dad

Jesus Christ, Summer!

Hey, Dad.

Um, hmm, what's this?

Making a controller.

This species of bionic space
whale has carbon wiring,

great for smooth gameplay.

I'm not killing it,
for the record.

I'm just replacing its esophagus
with a better one.

For free.
I-It should thank me.

And it will, with its mind.

These things are
telepathic, Beth.

They talk to you
in dreams.

Does your replicator thing
make ice cream

from the Gloppy Drop system?

Why would you want replicated
Gloppy Drop ice cream, poser?

Crazy thing. I went with
Space Beth to get some,

and we had such a great time
we forgot the ice cream!

Crazy, right?

That's a real question?

M-Maybe?

Come here,
hold the pup down.

You're talking about
an infinite father.

I've met myself out there
infinite times.

Infinite shit happens.

Including, as you put it,
forgetting the ice cream.

You've...
forgotten the ice cream?

Drill me for details
when I'm drunker.

In the meantime, don't worry
about what's crazy.

You know, as the kids say,
you do you.

Oh, thanks.
Thank you so much, Dad.

One thing to keep in mind,
though.

It's not just your own ice cream
you're forgetting.

It's your family's.

If you forget it too much, you
start having to keep secrets.

Oh, and you're against
secrets?

Against? Hell no.
Secrets are great.

For instance, I've had
a pint of vanilla

Gloppy Drop in my fridge
this whole time.

Take it.
I'm just saying, lies pile up.

Like credit card debt.

You retain an advantage
by staying liquid.

Gotcha.
Well...

I'd call this a simple
cash transaction.

Fun and done.

Favorite Culkin.

- Kieran!
- Kieran!

Favorite song by Britney.
"Work Bitch"!

"Work Bitch"!
Favorite hangover cure.

Hair of the dog with a guilty
Hair of the dog with a guilty

pleasure like "Humans Weekly."
pleasure like "Us Weekly."

I told Dad.

I mean, I didn't have to.
He knew.

I guess that's one reason
you didn't have to tell him.

What'd he say?

We kind of talked in code,
I think he said it's fine

until it makes us feel
indebted to our lessers.

That sounds like Dad.

Do we owe...
the family an explanation?

Do we have to spend
our time together

figuring out
how to please others?

I'm married.

We both are,
but I'm in our marriage.

It's the defining difference
between us.

Well, there's no rule book
that says you have to be.

What's gonna happen?

What is this?
Are we in love...

with ourself?

I mean, does that make us
the most

or the least healthy woman
in the universe?

Anybody ever tell you
you're overly analytical?

Which I do love.

If that's what you need
to call it.

I don't need to call it
anything.

I would like to know...
its shelf life.

I might know a way
to gather that data.

Motel room!
The Holodeck!

I like yours better.

Hmm...
Uh...

Beth!
Uh, m-my Beth!

Well, not "my" Beth, but --
I finished!

It's done!

Kids, do you know
where your moms are?

Oh, you're busy
with your GamePod.

Don't worry about it,
I'll find those two somewhere.

No! No, Dad, um, come play
video games with us!

Okay, Dad, here's
the infinite menu screen.

Oh, I dunno.

Here, here, I-I'll have
the console choose a game!

Um, maybe
let's skip this one?

Really? Why?
Looks fun!

Oh, okay, so we are

a woman married to a man

but having a sexual affair

with another woman!

Very spicy.

Very spicy, Jer.
G-Good job.

Looks pretty
single player, kids?

Seriously, you two?!

What the hell did you do
in my Holodeck?!

Holy shit, you -- you did a full
"San Junipero" in here?

Oh, my God, Beth,
there's masturbating

and then there's masturbating.

Ew, Dad stop, I'm sorry!
You'd know, old man.

Argh!
Look, this isn't my business,

and by all means, enjoy being
sapphic horse girls together.

But you suck at doing
it secretly.

We all know.
Including Jerry?!

No, Dad's so in the dark
that he's enjoying a video game

about being in an affair
right now.

If you guys are doing this,
you got to tell him!

Okay, little man,
back off.

Take it easy.
They're right.

Right about what,
that we have to be twice

as considerate and twice
as repressed

because some dick
split us in two?

This is the shit I left.
This isn't. This is me.

This is the me that doesn't
tell you all to fuck off.

So allow me.
Fuck off.

She'll tell her husband what she
wants when she feels like it.

And you can deal with it
or you can deal with me.

But you should know I have
all the Predator weapons.

Works for me.
Fair enough.
That's cool.

I guess it's time
for ice cream.

Come on, kids,
you're inhaling this stuff.

Your Moms went to space.

Did you even thank them
for doing it?

Thanks for...

doing it, Moms.

Very selfless of you.

Eat your ice cream
however you want.

Nothing good lasts forever.

Okay, come on,
it's Thanksgiving.

The least we can do
is speak English.

Jerry, I had sex
with your wife.

Or I'm your wife and had sex
with the clone you sleep with.

Your pick.
We had sex. We loved it.

Beth Sanchez sure
is something, huh?

I think
I'll ask her to prom.

Jerry,
for your own sake,

stay away
from Beth Sanchez.

Worst case,
she says "no."

No, Jerry.
Worst case she says "yes."

She's too much
woman for you.

Yeah, maybe she'd find
your simple naiveté endearing,

but she's intense.

Sooner or later,
she'd tear you apart.

I'd be lucky to be
torn apart by Beth Sanchez.

-Aah!
-What the fuck?!

Dad's a bug!
Dad rolled into a bug!

Oh, yeah.
Sh-- Forgot I installed that.

Why does Jerry have
a Pill Bug Protocol?

It's an emotional
defense system.

I got drunk
with Jerry one night

and he said it's what
he wanted most in the world.

Don't blame me,
I wanted tattoos.

Anyway, he's in perfect health
in there

and he can unroll
when he chooses to,

but can also stay
in metabolic hibernation

pretty much indefinitely.
It's a cool power to have,

like if you have
to fly coach or if

Summer asks you what you thought
of "Wonder Woman 1984."

How do we undo it?
Only he can.

That's the point.
It's total safety.

Even I can't reverse it.

If you try to pry him out
and hit a nerve,

he'll literally
turn into a Shrek.

In his own sad way,
he's taken control.

This is classic Jerry.

He'd rather be a bug
than have a conversation.

Oh, have you heard the way
you start conversations?

You ladies discuss
responsibility

while I get stoned and play
video games with your kids.

Fuck!
More forest!

L-Look around!

Try heading north.

Oh, shit.
Wait, what the fuck?

Um, maybe keep
heading north?

Ew, what the hell?

Oh, God, w-what happens
in the shadows?

Jerry, sweetie, if you can hear
me, please unroll.

He doesn't want to.

It's a little late to worry
about what he wants.

Jesus, Beth,
don't fall for this.

This isn't love,
it's a tantrum.

Yeah, but his tantrum
is self-destructive.

Yours is destructive.

Maybe that's why I'm the one
that loves him.

He worries.
He wants to do right.

He's ashamed when he fails.

Aren't those things
you love about me?

You want me to be like him?
You want me to propose?

Threaten to kill myself?

No.
I love you the way you are.

And I did it forever
in a video game.

But in life, things go wrong.
Things stop working.

I-I like to fix those things,
and when I can't,

I'm pretty useless.
Like my husband.

I don't get it.

You're the house wife
and I'm the space lady,

but you're the one that chewed
me up and spit me out.

I don't want to just forget
about you.

Me neither.

It's a problem.

But we know someone
that owes us a solution.

Oh, shit, we're out
of the forest.

We found a clearing.

Go check it out!
Go check out the clearing!

Vampires?!

Oh, come on!
That's not realistic!

Morty, it's obviously set
in a world

where vampires hunt
in clearings.

How did you --
I'm working with
the same information you are!

Ow!

No more screen time
until your homework's done, Dad.

-What did that mean?
-We refuse to care.

Damn. You really came of age
this Thanksgiving.

How old are we?

We've had a million
Thanksgivings.

Can I explain
how irrational this is?

Asked the guy
that cloned his daughter.

Will I ever live that down?
No.No.

You guys are having me
"Eternal Sunshine"

all the "Multiplicity" porn
scenes from your minds?

Yep. Basically.
Sounds right.

Meanwhile, everyone
around you --

your father,
your cuckhold husband,

your jaded children --
will just happily

and silently bear the burden

because it's more practical
for them than the truth

and you don't care because
it won't be your problem?

Solid repipe, Dad.

It's like he has a lifetime
of experience as a selfish ass.

When this fails and the two
of you fall in love again

and you attack me
for taking part in this,

I'm gonna lie and say I tried
to talk you out of it for hours.

In truth, I don't care.
Three, two --

Oh, for God's sakes,
all of you, grow up.

-Jerry! You unrolled!
-What the hell?!

Ooh, plot twist,
Deus Ex Husbanda.

Oh, don't lobotomize
yourselves for my comfort.

I may be a man, but I'm also
a baby, and babies

don't take responsibility
for other people's suffering.

I should never have said
I'd kill myself if you left me.

It's not true.

All I'd do is pack my shit
and cry

while I look for a job
on Starbucks Wi-Fi.

And that's what I'm gonna do.

So the two of you can get clone
lesbian married

by a robot and finger
yourselves on the moon

while laughing in Martian French
about my weird little dick!

Jerry, wait!

Jerry, don't leave angry.

Should I float out
on a lotus leaf?

I have to be twice
as confident

because my wife
cheated on me with herself?

It's not even cheating.

Oh, you here to help?
You suck.

You don't even know which one
is your real wife.

If it's me, have you been
cheating with a clone?

I'm not the clone,
but she has a point.

Oh, what a provocative
conversation it would've been

great to have before
the two of you --

and I am counting two --

gave each other
unfairly expert orgasms

while mocking my weird
little dick!

Jerry, you're the only
one who keeps saying

"weird" and "little."
Well, you've both seen it!

And you've both seen each other,
and now you want

to tell me all about it,
but it's a little late.

Oh, my God.

You're not mad that
it was about you.

You're mad that it wasn't.

He wanted
to permit our love.

Okay, it's not "Handmaid's Tale"
to loop in your husband.

I agree, for the record.
We made a mistake.

Oh, because we should've
noticed ourselves losing control

and gone to Sexmaster Jerry
and said, "Oh, pretty please,

Jerry, can I make out
with myself?"

Yes, you may.

Yeah, see. Not so hot when it's
aboveboard, home-wreckers.

Oh, so we won't
enjoy this?

Well, hold on, hold on,
this is weird.

Weird and permitted.

Wait, you like this?
Who cares what he likes.

I do.
I might like it.

And if she likes it,
I permit it.

You little pervert.
You like a little pervert.

I like humiliating
a little pervert.

I approve.
Carry on.

I'm freaked out
by how hot this is.

Am I permitted
to do this?

Until further notice.
I love it.

Then it's permitted
from now on.

Oh, because you like
whatever she likes.

Because you're a worm.

I will allow
that assessment.

-Pass the salt?
-I don't care what you allow.

-Damn it!
-What do you allow?

I allow this.

Well,
then it's required.

I approve
the requirement.

You get over there.
Good idea.

Oh, wow. Okay.
Uh, Honey?

I'm fine if you are.
You're never fine, shut up.

Okay, but -- Whoa! Okay.

This is not how
I pictured this, but --

I have zero complaints
so far.

Because I know
what you want.

I do not disagree
with that.

Can I make a pitch?
What if we...

Are you serious?

Hey, is -- is this
making fun of me?

Well, is that bad?
I'll allow it.

Jesus Christ, you need
to fix the portal gun, Rick!

Morty, you asking makes me
want to do it less.

Okay, uh, Thanksgiving!

L-L-Let's talk
about Thanksgiving!

Who's thankful for what?
Go, Summer, y-you first.

Um, I guess I'm thankful,
for like, water?

Perfect! Wonderful!
Morty, w-what about you?

F-F-Fucking
Are you fucking kidding me?

Why? Why?
Discovery Channel!

Discovery Channel, why?!

Okay.
Just eat your food.

Ea-Ea--
Everyone eat the food.

Sorry, I'm --
Is this? Ooh!

Well, bye, kids!

I'll keep an eye out
for my grandkid in space.

Your what?

Oh, right.
"Naruto."

Thanks for visiting,
Space Beth.

Well, seems like we all learned
a little lesson this weekend!

At least, I know I did.

Me, too, Jerry.
Me, too.

Hello there, Jerry!
How can I help you today?

Howdy! Yeah, just, uh --
just here to hang!

Oh, I'm sorry, sweetie.

You can't come here
by yourself.

Why not?
It's just me in there!

Well, not that this is
something you'd do,

but sometimes we have
Jerries come here

and try to touch other
Jerries.

Oh, no, that's --
that's not good.

Uh, well,
see you later!

Okay.
Thank you.

Did you get any of that?

We're out of syrup.

Huh.
You know what?

Maybe I'll use
my intern.

- Glootie?
- Good?

- Thanks, Glootie.
- Anything else?

Do you want to develop
an app?

- No thanks, Glootie.
- Hey, what's up, Glootie?

Hi, Morty.
Do you want to develop an app?

- No thanks.
- Rick, why does it say,

"Do not develop my app,"
on your intern's forehead?

Why, you want to
develop one?

Ah, I'm glad
you asked that, Jerry.

It's so youdon't develop
his app.

Glootie, go make some
photocopies of something.Cool.

Well, if anyone wants to develop
an app with me, I'm down.

He seems to reallywant
to develop an app.

He really does, sweetie,
but nobody's gonna do that.

Now,
if you'll excuse me,

I've got a quick
solo adventure to go on,

and this one will notbe
directed by Ron Howard.He's gonna go poop.

When Grandpa Rick pats
his belly like that

and leaves without Morty,
it means he's going to go poop.

He's a shy pooper.
He has a secret pooping place.

Man, fuck you, Summer.

Honey, why can't you get
this excited about your SATs?

Well, I'm man enough to simply
say, "I'm going to poop,"

and I'd be honored to have
Ron Howard involved.

Good job, hon.Way to go, Dad.We're rooting for ya.

He's really putting you
to work, huh?

Did you want to
develop an app?

- I'll pass, Glootie.
- Hmm, your loss.

Oh, yeah?
Why's that?

Eh, it's an app
you'd want to develop.

- Can I ask what it is?
- Of course you can.

That's always the first step
in app development.

Ah.

50/50!
Final offer!

Reverse digestion
extrapolation.

Time to meet your maker.

What are you guys
doing?

Did you develop
an app?

Rule number one
in app development, son --

never follow the rules.

Except when the rule is tattooed
on an alien's forehead, Dad.

Why do you think
Rick would have that rule?

'Cause he's
a disrupt-o-phobe.

No, Dad, no.

To keep something horrible
from happening,

something he's too lazy
to explain.

Guys, we're getting
our first users.

Whoa, this new app
just matched me

with a guy
that is su my ty.

Super my type.
Learn to abbre.

Hey!

Your su ty works
at Jersey Mike's

and sees 25 Phish shows
a year.

- That is so Danny.
- Summer!

- Danny?
- Summer Smith?

Danny Publits from Lovefinderrz
with two "R's" and a "Z"?

I ran all the way here
while staring at your profile.

I tripped on a fire hydrant
and fell down,

so I'm covered in gravel
that stuck to my sweat.

And even after a shower,

I'll still be into a jam band
for old junkies,

but I think this world cares
too much about bands

and too little
about love.

And I think I love you.
- Me, too.

Hi, I'm my underaged
daughter's mother.

Nice to -- whoa!

Come on. Just met.

Uh, this isn't working.

Wait.
What are you--

Never mind.

I quit, I'm gay,
and I love Xander.

Stupid phones
are destroying us.

Hey, sweetie.

Honey, our daughter ran off
with a Frisbee golfer

because of some app
with a really dumb,

really forgettable name.

Like a really dumb, uncreative,
super sweaty name.

Anyway, I'll be late.
I love you.

Got it.
I love you, too.

Okay, Glootie,
take the app down.

Can't take it down.
I'm just an intern.

Uh, that's not
how apps work.

Then make it
how it works.

This isn't how
making things work works.

Get -- get it off
the server.

Y-You think we're stupid,
but we're not.

We know apps have something
to do with servers.

The server's on
the mother ship.

Where's
the mother ship?

- It's coming.
- Take us to it.

- No.
- Yes.

Shake him more, Morty.
That was working.

Take us
to the mother ship.

Okay, don't hurt me.
Don't hurt me.

An ominous beeping app.

You can't stay made at a guy
with this kind of talent.

Dad, you can,
and you have to.

- Ribbit, ribbit.
- Ribbit, ribbit.

- Hey, ribbit, ribbit, ribbit!
- Ribbit, ribbit, ribbit!

Look at this guy.
He wants to eat me so bad.

You want to eat me,
don't you?

- Ribbit.
- Just kidding. Have some drugs.

- Are you Vermigurber?
- What does this guy want?

Who is this monkey?
- I'm here about a sandwich.

Oh, well you came
to the right place...

...'cause you're about to get
a bulletsandwich

on two slices
of whole...gun.

You might want
to get that.

Hello?

Dad, give the human
whatever he wants.

He knows where I live.
He's crazy!

You fucking idiot.

I have 800,000 kids.

Don't forget
your voicemail.

You have 470,000 messages.

Oh, ah,
that's half of them.

Okay, w-w-what do you want?
What do you want?

Wait, this is seriously
about sandwiches?

I thought this was
about drugs or guns

or the fact that I'm a fly
that runs a frog restaurant.

There's a million things
that are interesting about me,

and none of them
are sandwiches.

- Who ordered it?
- Talk to our delivery drone.

He -- he run off to fight
in the robot wars.

Hey, ape man,
I hope this was worth

making a whole swarm
of enemies.

It will be when I find
whoever shit in my toilet.

Is that code for something?
Someone look that up.

If that's drug slang,
I need to know it.

- Mom, you can't stop true love.
- Oh, yes, I can.

- You're assaulting me!
- Keep your voice down.

I'm being assaulted!

Oh, yeah? Okay.

Statutory rape!
- Whoa.

My daughter's about
to be raped!

No, I'm not!
I'm being assaulted!

- Rape!
- Assault!

- Rape!
- Nobody cares. It's a motel.

Nobody's here because
their life's going so great

they can afford
to get mixed up in yours.

Deal with this shit
on your own.

You can't stop us
from getting a motel room.

Fine.
I'll get one, too.

I'm getting
the one next door,

and I'm putting a glass
to the wall, and I'm listening.

- Fine. Enjoy.
- I will.

- I'm Danny, by the way.
- You had your chance, dick.

Take your app down.

T-Take -- take it down.

- What?
- I'm their hostage.

- Do they have weapons?
- Nope, but neither do it.

Do -- do youhave
a weapon?

No.

- Take the app down.
- Take the app down.

I can't.
I'm an intern.

Okay, well who tells interns
what to do?

Not you,
that's for sure.

Take us to whoever does,
or w-w-we'll -- we'll punch you.

Okay.

Not bad, Morty.

Yeah, I don't know when
the other shoe's gonna drop,

but this is working
pretty good so far.

Greetings.
We are the Monogatrons.

While your species was
still toying with fire,

ours mastered the science
of functioning,

committed relationships.

As the latest planet
to develop our app,

you will now witness the true
power of superior intimacy.

Take the app down.

Take it down, or...we'll --
we'll -- we'll punch you.

Is there someone
with a gun or --

It's on its way.

The app remains up.

So what's
the evil plan?

Does there have to be
an evil plan?

- Oh, uh, uh...
- Uh, someone wanted a gun?

I'll take it. Thanks.

Here's the evil plan.

- Fuck!
- Goddamn it.

As a preapp civilization,

your love's value
is defined by scarcity.

You are highly trained
to seek it,

and you have no idea
how to maintain it.

Had you bothered
to master love,

you would've learned by now,
it is as abundant as water.

You know what isn't?
Water.

That shit runs out.

So we'll be taking yours.

While your planet continues
to dick around with a, uh --

what is their version
of it called?

Lovefinderrz,
with two "R's" and a "Z."

- Oof.
- Yeah, not my idea.

- Goddamn.
- Am I interrupting?

- Impossible. Here she is.
- Mwah.

Your prisoners
are getting away.

Prisoners
are just things.

Connect with me.
Tell me about your day.

I had
an incredible meeting.

Did you know humans
are 80% water?

And I found a new podcast
we can listen to tonight.

Love it.

Okay, back to work.

Find and kill
those earthlings.

We're outnumbered.
There's no hope.

Then we go out
in glory.

Flesh intruder,
prepare to die.

Oh, hold on.

My apologies,
Lieutenant Commander.

No problem.
At ease, Solider.

Initiate Employee
Evaluation Mode.

- Accessing delivery archive.
- Okay, listen.

You delivered an avian
protein club sandwich

with no lettu--
Goddamn it.

Oy, scoping
for this bit, then?

Alright, a-a-alright.
I know you want to have

the big guy/little guy fight, but--

Aw, are you
fucking kidding me?

Here at the Midland Quasar,
where, in a complete upset,

the Robolution has overturned
the lizards.

It's totally unexpected.

Uh, I understand,
Mr. Phillips.

Yes.

I believe
this is yours.

You, uh --
you dropped that.

I'll have to
call you back.

Where do you
want to die?

Susan, is conference room three
available?

Can I look at a photo
of my wife while you kill me?

Sure,
but I'm doing her a favor.

She either has
terrible taste,

or she's trapped in a marriage
to a toilet thief.

She's dead.

And I don't mind
joining her.

Life has been hollow
since I lost her.

Using your toilet
was nice, though.

I'm a bit
of a shy pooper.

I'm ready when you are.

Stay there.

Tell him
what you told me.

What is this?
What's happening?

Tell him
what you told me.

My wife's still alive.

Sh--sh--she went into remission
10 years ago.

And what did you do
today?

Oh, I, uh, pooped

on a really awesome toilet
I found --

oh, ow, ow,
ow, ow, oh!

Don't use your dead wife
as an excuse.

You shit on my toilet because
you don't know your place,

and your place
is nothing.

So next time you stumble
onto a toilet

that feels too good
for your ass, trust me, it is.

You're not gonna
kill me?

Don't tell me
what to do!

♪ She say, "This is my shit,
my shit"♪

♪ See the flick of my wrist,
of my wrist♪

♪ And I know
she know what's up♪

♪ Baby, this is my shit,
my shit♪

♪ See the flick of my wrist,
my wrist♪

Are you fucking kidding me?

♪ When you in my section,
fill it up when my cup empty♪

♪ I can't fuck with rats♪

♪ That's a fact,
that's a dub nigga ♪

Oh, so you like being alive?

So why the fuck
are you back here?

After you left,
I thought about what you said

and how much
I needed to hear it,

but then I thought about
whyyou were saying it,

who you were really
saying it to.

You need the same thing
I needed, Rick.

You need someone to give you,
permission to live.

What the...?

I thought
you were a shy pooper.

You know what
shy pooping is, Rick?

It's a pointless bid
for control.

You want to take
the one part of life

that you truly think is yours,
and you want to protect it

from a universe
that takes whatever it wants.

It took my wife.

It clearly took something
from you.

We can spend our lives
fighting that,

or we can choose
to be free.

You're right, Tony.
I'm done fighting.

Time to be free.

Oh, wait,
you're actually gonna --

Oh, God!
Oh, God!

Where am I?
- Hi, little mouse.

Baby bee?
I missed you so much.

I never really left you.

Then you know
that a few years ago

I started getting into --
- Strap-on porn?

Yes.
I thought it was hot.

Now, come on.
- Where are you going?

- To poop.
- Where?

Wherever you want,
forever.

My God.

You rang?
I'm pooping, too.

Come, Tony.
Come on.

Come poop with me.
Poop with me, Tony.

Poop with me.

What are you waiting for?

Aren't you gonna join us,
Tony?

Aren't you gonna join us
in the pooping?

Where are we?
What is this?

That's it.
Get out.

You can make
a perfectly-realized,

toilet-filled simulation
of heaven,

but you can't share
a toilet?

Don't insult my craft.

The chemical
is Globaflyn.

It connects the
whatever-you-want section

of your brain to the
whatever-you-have section.

If your heaven is toilets,
that's on you.

All of these people...

Are living their wildest,
meaningless dreams

and leaving me
out of them.

People you refuse to kill and
refuse to let into your life.

An offer you rejected,
so here's your last chance.

Goodbye forever. If you touch
my toilet again, you die.

You need a friend.

I have a million
cooler friends than you.

- I'll be seeing you.
- You'll be dying.

- We're gonna be friends.
- You're gonna be dead.

So, we fight our way
to the gas line,

we cut it,
and then we set a fire.

Okay. Alright.

Morty, "Adventures of Jerry
and Morty," huh?

Put her there.
- Dad, look, y-you know,

w-we don't need
to high-five.

It's --
it's kind of your fault

that we're in this situation
at all.

I know, but,
you know, come on.

"Adventures of Jerry
and Morty."

Okay.

Mwah.

Jeff, I can explain
everything.

You don't have to.

Can you just marry us
instead?

Jeff, don't do it!

Richard.

Maggie.

- Running Bird.
- Let's get out of here.

- Priest Witherspoon.
- Josiah?

Let's get the fuck
out of here.

Summer Smith, let's get
the hell out of here.

You had me
at my own name.

Oh, yeah, no.
Why would I...?

Summer!

Fucking thing.

Come on. I can't steer this.

What in the hell
are you doing?

- Parenting.
- That's not how I did it.

Yeah,
where's yourdaughter?

Ah, you're right.

She joined ISIS.

It's Glootie, and he's had
a change of heart.

And he's going to
set us free.

Actually, he's been blamed
for bringing you aboard

and assigned
to execute you.

Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Okay.

What would your girlfriend
think of you murdering?

I happen to be between
relationships right now.

Really? I thought your species
had perfected relationships.

Here.We're not allowed
to use those apps.

I wonder why.

Yeah, that's what I thought,
Glootie.

Looks like you and I...

...are all we've got.

I'm not helping you
any more than that,

but if you can find
the hangar,

grab a ship
and get the hell out of here.

Where you going,
Glootie?

I've got a date
with dumping a dating app.

Glootie-ootie-ooh!

- Was that ever his thing?
- No.

- He never exited that way.
- No, first time.

Dad,
I want to say something.

I started today disgusted
and embarrassed to be your son,

and then later I thought
we were gonna die

because you're a loser.

- There's no more, is there?
- Nope.

Now quit fucking up,
and let's go.

Is Tony here? I br--
I brought him some, uh,

Vegan Fiber Chili,
delicious family recipe,

and a box of these, uh,
chocolates, sugar free.

He can eat as many of these
as he wants.

Anyways, uh, just wanted
to drop these off,

and you tell him, uh,
the toilet's all his.

H-He -- he'll know
what I mean.

Tony died.

- Excuse me?
- He quit his job,

starting living life
to the fullest.

He crashed into a tree

space-skiing
down Mount Space Everest.

Fuck.

There's
a Mount Space Everest?

Okay.
Uh, Jesus.

I-I got to process this.

Oh, no, no. You --
you don't want to eat that.

Y-y-you'll -- you'll --
you'll become

the opening
of "The Beverly Hillbillies."

You know what I'm saying?
A little bubbling crude?

Texas tea?
- I don't know these references.

Yeah, but you have
a Space Everest?

Watch
"Space Beverly Hillbilllies"

so my jokes can land,
you fucking twat.

Now what?

Happily ever after.

And after that?

We'll find out
together.

Summer, how many soul mates
is that in the last week?

Four. You can't stop me
from loving who I love, Mom.

Oh, the shit I can't.

I'm gonna mother you
until your 18th birthday,

even if I get thrown in prison
for non-consensual mothering.

And even then,
I will break out,

come to your house,
kick down your door,

and mother your fucking face
out of your stupid asshole.

I'm gonna daughter
your brains out, bitch.

Motherfucker!

That's my name.
Don't wear it out.

Gimme dat new soul mate.

Ad wall?

Fuck this.

Ad wall?What, they want us
to pay for it now?

Ugh, ad wall?

Come on, Mom.
Let's go home.

Great.
We lost Earth.

We aren't defined by what we do,
and we only need each other.

Each other --
and water.

There's no water?

Honey, the whole point
of conquering Earth --

I know the point
of conquering Earth.

Don't talk to me like --
- Like I'm thirsty?

Like I'm your mother,
you childish prick.

How much water
are you sucking

through these stupid
fucking tubes on your back?

These tubes are cool,
and I want a divorce.

You can have one for a glass
of Goddamn water.

Look, uh, on the off-chance
that you used the app

and there's someone out there
waiting for you, I, uh --

Jerry, I didn't use it.
Did you?

Me? No.
God, of course not.

Well, then,
we're all good, dawg.

Hey, uh --
Hey, uh, Tony's dad,

uh, th-this is, um, $8 billion
in your local currency,

and, uh, this is a kit
you can use to clone a new son.

He -- he won't have
the same brain.

He'll kind of be an animal man,
but you can teach him stuff.

I-I-I also wanted
to let you know

I did explore
infinite universes,

and there is a version of Tony
that was completely evil

and ended up causing
a lot of genocide

because of
how fulfilled he was.

So, really, a lot of ways
of looking at this

as not much of a loss.

I understand.

It's, uh, hard
losing a friend.

- Fuck you.
- What?

He's not my friend.

There he is.
There's our guy.

Congrats, Tony.

Have fun
with your stupid toilet

that you get to use
all by yourself now.

Enjoy using it all by yourself
while you sit there

and think about how nobody
wants to be around you

and how you ruined it
for yourself

because you're
a huge piece of shit.

Look at you sitting there,

King Shit on his throne
of loneliness.

Enjoy this toilet with
a thousand of me

screaming every time
you take a shit.

All hail his majesty,

the sa-a-ddest piece of garbage in the entire cosmos.

Long live the big, bad,
doo-doo daddy.

May his reign last
1,000 years.

Rick, did you take
the Tapatío?

Hmm, Globaflyn?

Thanks.
I could never lift it up.No problem.

I'll be able to drink water
for weeks because of you.

It's just part of my job,
ma'am.

Breaker one nine,
this is Jerry Smith.

Uh, just finished
my first delivery of the day.

900 more to go.

Rick, I-I'm not rated
to climb something this sheer.

Look, you're the guy
that wanted an epic adventure.

I'm the guy
with only one hover chair.

Goddammit, an alien spider
just bit my finger!

It's an alien cliff.

You can just say spider.

You couldn't do that
an hour ago?

I was eating,
and you're dirty.

Activate
anti-booby suits.

Total waste of snakes.

If you want to take a beat

to acknowledge
the sacred atmosphere,

it could give
the cynical grave robbing

a hint of irreverence.

No, I'm -- I'm good.All right, then.

Let's loop this corpse.

Hey, where's the...

Wait, what?

Is that an origami horse?

It's a calling card from Miles
Knightley, a heist artist,

AKA a hipster dick

whose adventures are 60%
putting a crew together

and 40% revealing that
the robbery already happened,

and he's not worth our time

because he's a hack piece
of shit fuck!

I'm gonna kill him!
Let's go, Morty.

This temple's for fuckin'
lame baby dipshits.

Who disturbs my slumber?

Also, who rigs a tomb
to crush the buried person?

Isn't the point to protect --

Aah!

This dork.
He has a convention now?

Come on.
What are we doing?

Huh!
Tuxedo scuba lessons? Ooh!

A signing with Catherines
Alpha through Omega Joneses!

You know, this is great
source material

for this heist movie
that I'm writing.

Don't get drawn
into the culture, Morty.

Stealing stuff is about
the stuff, not the stealing.

Where is the entrance?

Oh, brother.

More like
Trying Too Hard Con.

Guests or professionals?Uh, guests.

Uh -- Uh, guests are fans,Morty, which we are not.

We'd like professional badges.

Do you have a crew?Yes.

He's a getaway driver
with Asperger's,

and my butthole
is a demolitions expert.

How much is it to get in?

If you want professional badges,
you need to put a crew together.

Or we could sneak in
like professionals.

Can't wait.Whoa!

Oh, for God's sake.

And you wonder why
we aren't fans.

Let that ointment sit
for 10 minutes or you'll die.

Don't let it sit for 
or I'll have to hunt down
what you become.

Can't you just buy
a guest badge?

Fuck you for asking,
Morty.

That would be
a symbolic expression

of support for this genre.

Then how do we get in?

With a little help
from some old friends.

Rick Sanchez,
you son of a bitch!

Need some people for a thing,
Glar.

My name's
Gleer these days.

I play piano.

Hey, Gleer.
Play your piano.

I quit! Augh!

And the name's Glar!

Sanchez,
you son of a bitch.

Never thought I'd see
Angie Flint

picking ticks off a pig.

Nobody's hiring an ex-con

with fake hands
to build an ion engine.

Suppose I had a job that didn't
care if you'd done time

or whatever's going on
with your confusing-ass hands.

I'm in.

Is this the guy?

No.

That the guy?

Nope.

Him?
No.

No, wait. Y-Yes.

Yeah, of course that's the guy.

Hey -- Hey, Truckula!

You son of a bitch!
I'm in!

Thanks for doing this,
guys.

It's the job.That was it. Bye.

And then, the police stole
the paintings

because the police were us
in police outfits.

Thank you!

It's showtime, Morty,

and I don't mean
a bad impression of HBO.

I mean, "Time for a show."

Another heist question
from a fan?

Uh, how about a rhetorical one

from someone that had to be
reminded that you exist?

Hey, pal!
That's not the question line!

Lab coat --
Ripoff Dr. Strange.

Wha--

Rick Sanchez, everyone.
Smartest man in the universe.

And a savage critic
of the heisting arts.

Your boos mean nothing!

I've seen what makes you cheer!

My question is,
"Seriously?"

Lab coat -- end ripoff.

Aah!

You stole the gem I needed
to split tachyons

and probably fenced it

so the 80 people that did all
the work could each buy a beer.

You're not an artist,
you're Postmates.

I doubt this rivalry
can be settled with words.

Why don't we make things
interesting?

I challenge you to a heist of
the crystal skull of Horowitz.

In a heist off!

That doesn't
make things interesting.

It makes them "Ocean's Twelve,"
by far the worst one.

Every breath I take
without your permission

raises my self-esteem!

State your terms.

First crew
to heist the skull wins.

The other endures
heist culture's greatest shame.

They must join
the winning crew.

Lame. I accept.

Please welcome
Knightley's Eight!

Snake Arms! Double Microwave!
Monitor Lord! Key Catcher!

The Shape Shiftress!
Angie Flint! Glar! And Truckula.

Hey!
Half of Knightley's Eight

are just three
of Sanchez's Five!

Well, no heist is complete
without a double cross,

and I had the perfect job.

Heisting the crystal skull.

That was it.
Bye.

Looks like you're available
for a job.

With Rick Sanchez on my team,
I'll be unstoppable.

Rick,
welcome to Knightley's Nine.

Ugh, ugh!

Ugh! Rick, for real?

Eh.
You got that skull, buddy?

What? How?

With a little help
from some old friends.

Heistotron,
state your prime directive?

To heist.

Calculate Miles Knightley's
current heist plan

and add one double-cross
with a switcheroo.

Compiling crew members
most likely to double-cross.

God damn it, Morty,
what did I tell you?

Rick,
I-I want to say goodbye.

Don't turn around.
I'll explain later.

Looks like you're available
for a job.

Your skills
are required for a job.

You son of a bitch.
I'm in.

Man, this is really
coming together.

You know, Rick, I've been
busy working on writing --

A heist script.

Yeah, you almost
never bring it up.

Oh, shit, we --
we should head over.

Hey, guys.
What do you got?

Pretty!

Morty,
put this in your backpack.

Grandpa's gonna run
to the bathroom.

Ugh.
Wasn't even a heist.

All you did was --

Write an algorithm

based on two heist movies
I slept through

and used it to automate
a joyless process you call art?

Yeah, I really did, didn't I?

So I'm in your crew now?

Yeah, well,
you're in good company.

Right, everybody?

Yes.

My God.

Your skills are required
for a job.

You son of a bitch. I'm in.What?

Your skills are required
for a job.

No, they aren't.

You son of a bitch.
I'm in.

Your skills are required for a job.

Sanchez's 3,329?

Yes.

Your next big score --

Steal every square inch
of Heistcon.

Oh!

Ah!
I got it.

Hey!
That's my wallet! Oh, God!

Oh, my God! Jesus.
Oh, my God.

Oh, fuck!

Holy shit.
Alright.

Look, Morty, I did not know
that that was gonna happen.

That's not on me.

Come on, Morty.
Let's go.

Good job, Heistotron.

Ah! Go ahead and shut down.

Negative.Excuse me?

I am programmed to always be
looking for the next big score.

You're programmed
to do as I say.

I am programmed
to double-cross.

You're not programmed
to double-cross me.

If I were, it wouldn't be
much of a double-cross.

You son of a bitch.
I'm in.

I'm in! I'm in!

What's the job?
I'm in.

I'm out!
I quit!

Whose kidneys are these?

Rick, w-what's happening?

Heistotron's gone rogue.
If we don't stop them,

all sentient life
will be absorbed

by the never-ending assembly
of a meaningless crew.

That's my hell, Morty.

I hate heists so much,

and the crew assemblies
are the worst part!

Oh! How are we gonna stop it?

With a little help
from some old friends.

Oooo, weee!

Before this semester's over,

you're gonna be real sick
of that phrase.

So. Who here thinks they already
know the work of Maya Angelou?

Ooo wee?

Ooo wee wa!

Ah, ooo wee!

Told you, Morty.

He's still got it.

You sons of bitches.

What's the job?

You son of a bitch.

We got a job, Hephaestus,

and there's no time
to argue about it.

I work in a volcano.

What jobs do you think
I've ever turned down?

Excuse me!
Are you Veltriloquiver?

Rick Sanchez, I presume.

Wow. As advertised.

A "yes" would've sufficed.

Guys, you're doing
a great job

getting these new Tusklas
out the door,

and we owe it all
to everyone's input.

Elon Tusk.

Listen,
we need your help.

Rick. Morty. Why me?

Did something happen to
Elon Musk in your own reality?

No, no, no, he's fine, but this
is a team operation,

and regular Elon can be
a little bit controlling.

Growing up with tusks
did pose social challenges.

It's possible overcoming them

raised my self-esteem
and incentivized collaboration.

Yeah, or you're less sure
of yourself

because you have monster teeth.

An equally valid theory.

Let's talk over here.

How serious is the situation?

Incredibly serious,
and every minute counts.

In that case, I'm sorry

I made you move over here
for no reason.

Well, yeah.
That was a little weird.

It's exactly
that kind of shit

that made us worry
about regular Elon.

Well,
we're not opposites, okay?

I'm just him with tusks.

Casing of planet initiated.

Hello there.

We are just here to check
your water pressure.

Hmm. Interesting intel.

It appears some giant hidden camera

has been dropped
on the planet,

killing an estimated total
of 57,000.

Executing heist.

People of Brandenplot,

we are here to deliver
that pizza you ordered.

Well,
if that's how you really feel,

I guess I should take
the pizza back.

I think we got away with it.

Commencing getting out of here
before they get wise.

Assembling calling card.

At this point, Heistotron
has become large enough

to heist entire planets.

Wouldn't this be better
with a blueprint on the table?

Blueprints are plans,
Elon Tusk,

and whatever we plan
will be canceled out

by Heistotron's reveal that our
plan was part of its plan.

That's why I picked
this crew at random

and why all of us will be taking
our orders from Randotron.

Let's get ready
to not rumble.

Bet you didn't
see that coming.

Instead of two heist movies
I slept through,

Randotron's algorithm is derived

from the plots
of three David Lynch movies

I pretended to like
to make my friends shut up.

If our collective behavior
is just random enough,

we should be able to walk
through Heistotron's

lazily contrived bullshit
like it's not even there.

Sounds good.

I don't really get it, but it
sounds like that's the point.

So you didn't need
a blacksmith?

We're ready when you are, Rick.

It's important our non-plan
starts randomly,

so we have to wait
until we're not ready.

W-Well, how long
will that take?

Obviously,
we can't know that.

Can we do things
while we wait?

Yes.
I'm gonna play Minecraft.

Oh, my kids play that.

I don't like these little jabs
you get in, Elon.

Strange.

Considering the time,
Cassiopeia's primary star

should be colinear with Orion
and Ursa Minor.

You don't shoot arrows
that carry your voice

without picking up
a little astronomy.

Wait a minute.

Jesus, no.

No! No!
We've already been heisted!

How could Heistotron heist us
if he's not even here yet?

He's already been here!

We've been watching
a recorded sky on playback.

Hello, Rick.

Okay, guys,
change of plans.

Random time detected.

No, Randotron,
it's not a good time!

That's why it's random.

Ooh!

21?

22?

Oooo weee, oooo weee, sold!

Oooo weee, that little hunk of
meat's going home to pappy!

I've been expecting you,
Rick.

But not like this, right?

It hardly matters.

Oh, yeah. Does this?

No. Your randomness
does not confuse me.

You are here now.

That was the plan.

I know.
It was part of mine, too.

I've got something to tell you.Let me guess.

When you invented me
and Randotron,

you swapped our brains.

That's right, buddy.

You're not the one
that's very good at planning.

You've been making
this shit up the whole time.

Rick, I think there's something
you should know.

God damn it, Morty,
what did I tell you?

That is something
I should know,

or at least something I should
have predicted, which I did.

Hey, Rick, I was thinking maybe
we could, like, raid a temple

and go on an epic adventure
later today, you know, like --

Morty, get out of my head.
I know just the temple.

And we'll grab a couple of
hover chairs on the way there.

Impressive.
But what does it even matter

if I'm random or planned?

My heists will still rule.

Well, if the brain inside of you
is actually Heistotron's,

it matters,
because it explodes

when it hits six levels
of contrivance.

Which is exactly
why even before --

Initiate clap sequence.

Clap, clap, clap,
clap, clap.

Adjusting clap rate.

Clap, clap.

Clap. Clap.

Clap.
Slow clap achieved.

Clap.
Well-done, Rick.

Randotron?

I'm afraid not.

Should be able to walk through
Heistotron's lazily contrived...

Not only did you just kill
your only ally,

what you thought was
a random non-plan

to get to me has been
a meticulously choreographed way

of bringing you all in.

Welcome to Heistotron's

975 trillion,

467 billion --That's impressive.

Did you bring us in
so that everybody would be here

when I reveal that you're gonna
explode after nine reveals?

By the way, you might not
want to answer that.

If you're talking about
the code adjustments you made

after I reprogrammed
your brain with my nanobots --

I'm immune to your nanobots.

You're immune to the ones
you designed, not mine.

I programmed you
to build nanobots

that were ineffective on me.

A belief
that needed to be placed

in your head by my nanobots.

You believe that
because I programmed you to.

That's what I'm saying to you,
though.

You believe what I programmed
you to believe.

Yes, because I programmed you
to believe that.

I programmed you
to believe that.

I programmed you
to believe that.

I programmed you
to believe that.

I programmed you
to believe that.

What's happening,
Professor Poopybutthole?

He's learning!

I programmed you
to believe that.

I programmed you
to believe that.I programmed you...

That was my plan the whole time.

That's what I wanted you
to think.

I knew you would say that.

I programmed you
to believe that.

You think that's true because
I wanted you to think that.

And I programmed you
to believe that.

A most curious algorithm.

It appears
the only perfect heist

is one that was never written.

Goodbye.

Oh, oh, oh, no.Shit.

Alright. Let's get the fuck
out of here!

Hurry! Go, go!

Rick, I think this was
a powerful lesson

in the dangers of AI,

which, by the way,
means "love" in Chinese.

Get the fuck
out of here, Elon!

The place is collapsing!

Oh, shit, Rick!
Rick, what time is it?

It's almost 3:00.
Why? What's wrong?

Oh, man, I-I'm sorry I didn't
tell you about this, Rick.

I just --

Well, you know that screenplay
that I've been writing?

Netflix is pretty interested,

and I've actually got a pitch
meeting there today at 3:30.

Oh, buddy.
Oh, that's amazing.

Yeah, well,
I know you're gonna say

that they're interested
in anything,

but, you know, it's a big deal
to me, and I've --

No, no, no! Morty, Morty, Morty,
I'm so excited for you.

Are you kidding me?

Listen, don't waste
any time explaining.

Let's go.
We can put the Earth back later.

Alright?Are you sure?

Priorities, Morty.

Let's get you
to that Netflix meeting.

Crazy day, huh?

Whole sky turned out to be
a big circuit board.

Yeah, that's actually
part of a-a-a --

an adventure I was having.

Very cool.

Traffic okay?
You have trouble getting here?

No, it was alright.

The planet's still contained

in this sort of big
storage grid machine,

so we were sort of already
pretty -- pretty close by.

Must be nice.
Try getting here from Malibu.

So good! Alright.

Well, l-let's hear about
this heist movie.

Okay, so,
it's kind of all --

all built around this big crew
with, like, a cool double-cross

and then this big awesome twist
where there's, like,

another double cross,
but then, um, but --

but then we reveal those things

were all part
of the hero's plan, y-you know?

And there's this other crew
they put together,

and their plan is to sort of
not have a plan,

but -- but that was part
of the other guy's plan, and --

Kid, if you're slowing down
'cause you think

you're doing bad right now,
Jesus Christ.

- That's a really good pitch.
- Loving it.

Man, you know, I --

I'm starting to think heists are
just really dumb now, you know?

I can't put my finger on why,

but I'd really like to go.

Are you sure?

Yeah, yeah, no,
I-I'm sure.

Man, it's as if someone stole
his enthusiasm for his own idea.

Yeah, without him
even knowing about it.

Without him
even knowing about it.

Fuckin' Morty's still working
on that stupid heist script.

He's up in his room with
his fuckin' thumb up his ass.

Skipped out
on the last three adventures.

I don't know.

Five of my friends
got Netflix deals.

What?

It's a very achievable goal.
You could lose him.

I'm not gonna fuckin'
lose him.

Fuck that.

I-I'm gonna nip this shit
in the bud.

No. As a matter of fact, you're
not nipping anything in the bud.

If Morty ever gives up
on a single dream,

it had better be because
of his own disillusionment.

Hey, buddy.
How'd it go?

I-I don't want
to talk about it.

Morty, you know, pal, you, uh --

you miss 100%
of the shots you don't take.

Yeah, I guess.

Thanks for staying positive
about my prospects, Rick.

Of course!
You know, you --

I got to help my grandson
follow his dreams.

Eh, who needs dreams?

I'll just hang out with you
and go on adventures

and do whatever you want to do,
you know, forever.

Oh, well, uh, okay.

I mean,
if that's what you want.

Oooo weee! Big storm coming.

Could be a twister.Mm-hmm!

Hey, Rick?

Can you walk me
through something?

Yeah.
What are you thinking?

So, you and Morty
knew you needed my help,

but you weren't sure
I was good enough at karate,

so you hired my grad students
to attack me?

Yep.

But it was an emergency,
Rick.

How long did that take?

It actually took less training
than you'd think.

Your students all shared

a pretty keen aptitude
for martial arts.

I don't know
if that's by coincidence

or if there's some correlation
with their passion

for African-American
Women's Studies.

Maya Angelou did personify both
acquiescence and perseverance.

Ooo wee. That's exactly
the kind of connection

I'd have loved
to explore in my class.

Too bad I lost my job

for putting my students
in the hospital.

Yeah. Yeah.

Sorry about that.

Mm-hmm.

Did you get any of that?

﻿MORTY: I gotta tell you, Rick.
It's pretty great...

to be in this spaceship,
just the two of us, you know?

Just cruising around,
Rick and Morty style.

I agree, Morty. [ BELCHES ]

It's nice to get
back to the basics

after a pretty intense,
mixed-bag of a year.

- Ohh!
- Relax.

That's what windshields are for.

I didn't know that
there were bugs out in space.

Well, w-what did you think,
Morty?

Life just developed
on Earth by itself?

Here, let me take care of this.

Geez, Rick, that's disgusting.
I don't wanna look at that.

Yeah, guess I'm out of fluid.

L-Let me find a place to stop.

Hey, muchacho, does your planet
have wiper fluid yet,

or are you gonna freak out
and start worshipping us?

The general store
ought to have what you need.

Thanks.

Of course, you'll be wanting
to be gone from here by sundown.

Yeah, sure thing.
Wait a minute. What? Why?

Sundown is when
the festival begins.

The festival?

Ooh, well, for millennia,

our society has been free
of crime and war,

- Living in perfect peace.
- Oh, I know what this is!

You've been able
to sustain world peace

because you have one night
a year where you all run around

robbing and murdering each other
without consequence.

- That's right.
- What?!

It's like "The Purge," Morty.
That movie "The Purge"?

Oh, have you been here before?

No, no, but I've been to a few
planets with the same gimmick.

You know, sometimes it's called
the Cleansing or the Red Time.

There was this one world that
called it just Murder Night.

I-It's a purge planet.

They're peaceful, and then,
you know, they just purge.

- T-That's horrible!
- Yeah.

You want to check it out?

♪♪

[ ELECTRICITY CRACKLING ]

So, what do you do
during the festival?

You lock yourself in,
or you go out and do some stuff?

Oh, I do some pretty bad stuff.

Oh, I bet you do, old timer.
[ LAUGHS ]

Gee... Rick, come on.
The sun is setting.

W-We got to get out of here.

All right, well, w-what do
I owe you for the wiper fluid?

It's on the house. Oh, and, uh,

why... Why don't you have
some candy bars, as well?

Oh, no way.
That's really nice of you.

I'm a nice guy... for now.

[ CHUCKLING ]
Ohh, I don't doubt it.

- Rick!
- Yeah, yeah.

Hey, have a good festival,
old timer.

I intend to.

Rick, unlock it!

Just a second, Morty.

Oh, look at that sunset.

Stop screwing around.

[ CLICK ]

There we go. Much better.
Now we can see.

Great.

Hey, you know what, Morty?

Why don't we christen our
squeaky-clean windshield here

by watching a little
of this purge through it?

What?! No!
What is your problem?!

Morty, grow up.
If you don't want to watch,

don't watch,
but, you know, it's my car.

[ BELCHES ] Also, if you
tell your mom about this,

- I'll purge you.
- You're the worst.

This planet is the worst.
How can you be into this?

You know, people are gonna
kill each other.

So, what, y-y-you trying
to sit here and tell me that

[BELCHES] I-if... if there's
a video online

with someone getting
decapitated,

- You don't click on it?
- No!

Why... Why would I do that?
You do that?

I don't,
because it would bore me.

I see shit like that
for breakfast, Morty.

But if you don't do it,
I say it's because

you're afraid of your own
primal instincts.

So you stuff them down and...
[ BELL CHIMING ]

Oh, oh! Shh. Shh. It's starting.

- Oh-Ho-Ho! Here we go.
- I'm not watching.

Yeah, yeah, yeah,
your medal's in the mail.

- I'm gonna get a closer look.
- Oh, okay, sure.

And then someone's
gonna throw a rock

and hit the car
and then we're gonna crash

and we're gonna
be stuck down there

and it's gonna be
what we deserve.

Yawn.

Whoa! [ INDISTINCT SHOUTING ]

Whoa, they are purging
the fuck out of each other.

[ MUFFLED SCREAMING ]

Oh, my god!

Oh shit!

That was...
Okay, yeah. T-That was gross.

Wow. Man, I think my eyes
were bigger than my stomach

on this one, Morty. Ugh.

My appetite for purge-spectating
got f-illed pretty quick.

Oh, god. [ GRUNTS ]

[ RETCHING ]

[ WOMAN SCREAMING ]

Get away from me!

No! No! Help!

Somebody help me! Aah!

All right, Morty.
L-Let's get out of here.

Wait, wait, wait. Hold on.
W-We have to go down there.

[ BELCHING ] What? Why?

That poor girl.
W-We have to save her.

Uh, Morty, in space,
we have something we call

the non-interference policy.
We got the wiper fluid.

We watched them kill each other.
We're leaving.

Help me save that girl, or I'm
telling mom you brought me here.

- You little turd.
- [ SCREAMING ]

Please! Leave me alone!

Leave you alone? During a purge?

I don't think so, baby.

It's okay.
We're not gonna hurt you.

My name is Morty.
This is my grandpa.

- We're tourists.
- Not anymore.

- Aah!
- Aah!

Oh, my god.
This is fucking awesome!

Morty, this is really cool.

Hey, y-you want to help me out
here and kill some people?

It's fun.
We're totally justified...

because we're saving
a little girl.

I mean, w-w-we're both free and
clear to murder these people.

- Are you okay?
- Yes.

I have to find
somewhere to hide.

Well, you can hide with us.
Rick?

- Yeah?
- Do you think we could take...

- W-What's your name?
- Arthrisha.

Could we take Arthrisha
up in the ship

and, you know,
just wait out the purge?

Oh, Morty, how can I refuse

after all you've done
to blackmail me?

Your vehicle...
Is it from the gods?

- No.
- Yes.

So, uh, you know,
when the purge started,

did people get into it
right away,

or were they like, "Wait, what?"

This is gonna stop crime
how, exactly?"

Yeah, it took some time
for people to accept it.

Yeah, I bet. [ CHUCKLES ] I bet.

Yeah, it's kind of like
cellphones, you know?

At first, everyone was like,

"look at those
douchebags purging."

And then
the next thing you know,

they're like,
"it's just so convenient."

Geez, you working on
your tight five

for the comedy store, Morty?

Whatcha doing?

Watching some TV,
playing on your phone?

- Is that a real question?
- Just making conversation.

Are you? What part of that
gives me anything to work with?

My choice is to say nothing,
be sarcastic,

or bark "yes"
like a trained animal.

It's not a conversation.

You're holding me
verbally hostage.

Okay, ass-face.
I'll go in the kitchen.

- Hey, Dad.
- Yeah?

Whatcha doing?
Going into the kitchen?

Okay.

- Yeah, you like that?
- Screw you.

So, uh, do most people
wear masks when they purge?

I-I don't want to answer
any more purge questions.

All right,
hey, hey, that's cool.

I can roll with that.

[ BLOWING RASPBERRIES ]

- [ GASPS ] My nana!
- Huh?

My nana! We have to save her!

You just now remembered
your nana exists.

I-I was traumatized.

Haven't you been through
like 15 purges?

I mean, some as a child?

Will somebody
just help me get her?

Fine, whatever. Morty, stay.

Oh, god. Oh, crap. Oh, crap!

- Get out! Get out!
- Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa!

Get the fuck out
of the flying machine!

Oh, my god! O-Okay! Okay!

- Back up, asshole.
- [ WHIMPERS ]

- Back up.
- Ohh.

- Back the fuck up!
- Aah!

For what it's worth, I'm sorry,

but that's not really
worth anything tonight, is it?

Y-You can't leave us here.
You're killing us!

You hear me? Come back.

Y-You got to come back.
Change your mind.

Oh, geez.

Morty! Aah!
Fucking Amish bitch shot me!

[ GRUNTS ]
She tried to purge me, Morty.

You let your wiener do
the walking, and now I'm dead.

- Rick, she took the car!
- You fucking kidding me, Morty?!

She took my car and the gun.

We're like the rest
of these assholes now.

W-W-We're gonna
get purged, Morty.

Help me up.

Oh, geez, geez!
Wait a minute, Rick.

Why don't we just use
your portal gun?

It's in the car, dip-ass.

[ GRUNTS ] Oh, god, it hurts.

She got me right in
the goddamn liver, Morty.

It's the hardest-working liver
in the galaxy, Morty,

and now it has a hole in it.
I hope it was worth it.

I was just trying to do right.

Yeah, well, that's not really
the theme of tonight's party.

Heads up. Rapists.

Well, don't just stand there,
Morty.

- Purge 'em.
- Me?

No, me. Should I rub
my liver hole on them?

Pick up a stick or something
and kill them.

- Um, w-we come in peace.
- [ SCREAMING ]

Oh, my god. [ GRUNTS ]

There's more
where that came from!

You want to get purged,
you bring it!

Drop [BELCHES] drop your shit!
Drop it all.

Morty, go get their shit.
Hurry up.

I only had one
of those things I threw.

I'm holding a box of Tic Tacs
right now.

- Want some crackers?
- No, thank you.

Are you ready to be nice to me?

In exchange for crackers?

- What happened to you?
- Dad, get a job.

You're trying to create drama
because you're bored.

Oh. [ BEEPING, WHIRRING ]

It's the space phone
Grandpa gave us.

- Hello?
- Hey, Summer, it's Grandpa.

I need you to do me a favor.

- I can barely hear you.
- Who is it?

Morty and I are on a planet
that's purging.

- I need you to take down...
- A plan that's what?

We're on a planet
that's purging, Summer. Purging.

We lost our car and my gun,
and we're in a purge.

- Ooh, is it Taddi Mason?
- Like the movie "The Purge"?

Yes, I-I need you to take...

- That movie sucked.
- Oh, my god. Hold on.

It's not Taddi Mason?

Dad, who the fuck
is Taddi Mason?

- My friend.
- Aah!

Are you okay?
I'm putting you on speaker.

- Taddi?
- Yes, Jerry, it's Taddi,

a person no one's ever heard of
until now,

calling you on a space phone.

JERRY: I can't tell
if you're being sarcastic.

[ GROWLS ]

Aah!

[ GROWLING ]

[ GUNSHOTS ] Reload, fast.

Summer, w-we need you
to take down this number.

- Quit screwing around.
- Morty? Are you all right?

- No!
- Why are you with Taddi Mason?

Holy shit Dad! Shut the fuck up!

Okay. I guess I'm just this
entire family's toilet paper.

Are you writing this down?
Will you please write this down?

- SUMMER: Yes, yes.
- 7-7-1-9-8...

- [ GROWLING ]
- 3-6-4-2-1-1-2-5.

Aah!

[ GROWLING ]

You son of a bitch!

Morty, I don't want to be
the "a little help" guy,

but a little help?

- Aah!
- Okay, I have a pen. Go.

7-7-1-9-8-3-6-4-2-1-1-2-5.

A spoon, Morty?

- A spoon?!
- I'm sorry.

There's a pile of silverware
next to you,

and you throw me the one thing
that can never kill anything?

All right, okay!

Summer, on the shelf above
my workbench in the garage,

there's a red box
with a keypad on it.

You're gonna
take that box outside,

and you're gonna type the number
I just gave you into the keypad.

- Got it?
- Got it.

Is it just part of growing up
to hate your dad?

I'm ignoring you.

Morty, if I can get to the top
of that lighthouse,

I can send the beacon, and your
sister can launch our package.

Just remember,
if there's people in there

and they try to purge us,
we got to purge them first.

We're not purging anyone, Rick,
all right? W-Will you stop it?

Morty, if we're gonna
survive tonight,

you're gonna need to harness
your repressed rage.

I don't have any!

Spoken like a person
with repressed rage.

[ DOORBELL RINGS ]

I take no part in the festival.

If you desire to kill me,
I only ask you do it quickly.

No such agenda, chief.

We're not too keen on the purge,
either, sir.

We were just hoping to get
on the roof of your lighthouse

so we can send a beacon
to my sister on Earth.

- It's a different planet.
- By the way,

life on other planets exists.
Don't let it distract you.

I'll let you use my lighthouse
for shelter and beacon-sending

on the condition that you listen
to my tale.

- Okay.
- Deal.

All right, I'm gonna go
to the roof and set things up.

- Morty, you listen to his tale.
- Okay.

[ CLEARS THROAT ]

"Fade in. Exterior.
Unnamed city. Day."

The hustle and bustle
is a symphony of progress.

We pan past windows, each of
which contain a different story,

to find Jacey Lakims, 28...
Hot, but doesn't know it.

Jacey stops
when her high heel gets caught

in the grating of a sewer.

Suddenly, a man steps into frame
and points a gun at her.

This is not her day.

Fade to black.

Title... 'three weeks earlier."'

[ SIGHS ] You really don't want
to talk to me about this.

Dad, Grandpa and Morty
are in danger.

You're unemployed,
and you're bored.

- They're a higher priority.
- Stop saying I'm unemployed!

Okay, 7-7-19-.8... 364... 2-1-
- 2... Aah!
- Good lord! Now what?

[ WHIRRING, HUMMING ]

Look, I'm your father, and
I love you is all I'm saying.

- I'll leave it at that.
- Fine, dad!

[ BOTH SCREAM ]

Oh, he might have said
to take it outside.

RICK: Come on, Summer.

How hard is it
to type some numbers into a box?

Target locked. [ DEVICE BEEPS ]

Oh, thank god.

Well, I did my job.
Summer did her job.

Now all Morty has to do is
finish listening to that tale.

BLANE: Maybe I don't need
a new friend.

JACEY: Maybe you're
the only friend I need.

BLANE: Need, or want?

JACEY: I've never been much
for wanting.

BLANE: Spoken like someone
with needs.

- Oh, geez.
- Hmm?

Uh, sorry. K-Keep going.

"Jacey reaches out
and touches his face."

It's clear he needs
what she wants.

She's a woman. He's a man.

The city burns in the background
as he takes her in his arms.

Fade out.

Title... 'The End'...

"question mark."

- Wow.
- Yeah?

It's... G-Good job. Good job.

- You liked it?
- Of course I did.

You didn't laugh
at the scene in the bar.

I... thought it was funny,
but I wanted to hear the rest.

Do you have any thoughts? Notes?

No. I-I just enjoyed it.

That's my note, you know?
Please write more.

- Seems a little insincere.
- What? No.

You don't have
to mollycoddle me.

I want to improve my writing.
Tell me your real thoughts.

All right. Well, um,
I'm not a huge fan, personally,

of the whole "three weeks
earlier" teaser thing.

I feel like, you know,

we should start our stories
where they begin

not start them
where they get interest...

- Get out.
- Um, what?

No, I'm sick of this.
You bang on my door,

you beg me to help you, I share
something personal with you,

and you take a giant shit on it.

Hey, man, we asked
if we could put up a beacon...

Well, you can't.
I want you out of here.

You're a petty person,
and you're insecure,

and you're taking it out on me.
That's a good script.

What the hell?!

I don't care. I want you out.

- What?
- Take that thing down.

Your grandson
is a shitty person. Leave now.

- Morty!
- Rick, I didn't do anything.

I sat through
his entire screenplay...

You "sat through it"?

Yes! Did you want me
to weep with joy?

- It's terrible!
- Whoa Morty! We're guests here.

I tried to be a good guest!
He dragged it out of me!

- I'm taking down this beacon.
- No, stop! That's not fair!

Just because
you hate your own writing

doesn't make me a bad person!

Aah!

You like that? You want me
to cut to three weeks earlier

when you were alive?

RICK: Whoa, Morty.
You just purged.

Beacon arriving.
[ DEVICE BEEPS ]

Okay, time to go.

- Well, terrific.
- [ SIGHS ]

Dad, what's going on?
What's the deal here?

I just wanted to spend some time
with my daughter.

You're growing up so fast.

- You used to be my little girl.
- [ CHUCKLES ] Yeah.

Remember when we used to
go to the playground,

and I'd push you on the swings?

Oh, you could push me higher
than all the other kids.

You were so small and cute.

I thought you were gonna fly
right off into the street.

[ CHUCKLING ]
I used to pee my pants.

I know, and now look at you!

You have a job.
You're making really good money.

You're not paying any rent,

so you have plenty
of disposable income.

Oh, god, Dad. Please, don't.

I just need
a few hundred dollars

to get through the month. I have
some interviews coming up.

Something's gonna come through.
I can feel it.

I'm going inside.

[ DOOR SHUTS ]

[ SIGHS ] I guess this is what
rock bottom feels like, Jerry.

Ow!

It's okay, Morty.
It's the purge, you know?

Pushing old lighthouse keepers
down the stairs is totally cool.

It's not cool, Rick.
I-I'm not like these people.

I can't run around chopping
people's heads off

one day a year and then
sleep well the rest of the time.

Well, you better start getting
used to it, little bitch,

because we got
some fucking company.

less diverse in there.

we weren't involved was...

"personality conflicts."

<i>Don't</i> --
[ <i>COUGHS</i> ]

<i>Don't make me say it.</i>

Oh, okay. This again.

You know [BURPS]
I could have made you a device

to detect Doomnomitron from
orbit like [SNAPS FINGERS] that.

I'm not the one that
didn't want you back. Alan was.

If you lay those deaths
at my doorstep one more time --

Do not threaten her.

<i>-[DING! ]
- Congrats, you did it.</i>

What the hell is "Israel"?

I-It's just something
Rick starts talking about

when he's blackout drunk.

W-What?
In w-- In w-w-what way?

Like, w-w-what's my point?

In a way that has no point.

You just babble about defense
budgets and the United Nations

and then you <i>pass</i> out.

So, to be clear,
I sometimes reference

the geopolitical complexities
of the topic,

which is not the same as going
to an anti-Semitic place.

I have no stake in this.

I don't, either. I'm --
I'm just saying, if anything,

the drunk version of me is
probably so supportive of Israel

he wants what's best for it
and --

Hey, man, I'm not touching this.
You do you.

<i>Aloha...means hello
and goodbye in Hawaii.</i>

<i>But, uh, aloha means</i> --

<i>has nothing to do
with this room.</i>

[ <i>COUGHS</i> ]
<i>I'm so fuckin' drunk.</i>

<i>Ugh, okay.
Here's the deal.</i>

<i>I-I want to rest my eyes
for a little bit.</i>

<i>I'm -- I'm not going to sleep.</i>

<i>I just -- just need
to rest my eyes,</i>

<i>so let's make this one simple.</i>

<i>Just...try to hit
some three-pointers.</i>

<i>Let's say...you have to
hit...five three-pointers</i>

<i>in...five minutes...or --
I don't know --</i>

<i>the whole place -- the
whole planet will get blown up</i>

<i>-with a n-neutrino bomb.
-[ BEEP</i> ]

<i>And try to make it a-a lesson
about yourselves,</i>

<i>like</i> -- <i>like
how selfish you are</i> --

<i>are or something.</i>

<i>And also Hawaii.</i>

[ SIGHS ]
You guys hit the baskets.

I'll disarm the drunkenly
improvised neutrino bomb.

There's a 40% chance it's a dud,

but y-you should still
stay back.

- Morty, how many of these --
- Too many, Rick! Too many!

Man, I am really getting
high-roaded today.

<i>-[ DING ]
- That's a three-pointer.</i>

- Nice shot.
- Thank you.

You two make quite a team.

-[ GROANS]
- We all do.

Yeah, I guess.

<i>-[ DING ]
- That's a three-pointer.</i>

But you guys have always had
a -- an unspoken bond.

I mean <i>really</i> unspoken.

Like, let's-not-tell-my-husband
unspoken.

[ BUZZER]

We aren't married anymore, Alan.

Sure, but were we married

when you two were "stranded"
on Delphi Six for three days?

Because I <i>sensed</i> something
was weird when you came back,

but what do I know
about sensitivity?

I'm just
a phantom train conductor.

You're the pile of ordinary bugs
that fucked my wife!

<i>-[DING ]
- That's a three-pointer.</i>

Where the fuck
is the lead wire?

You always put it
in the weirdest place.

Um, uh, over here maybe?

Jesus Christ,
what a shitty neutrino bomb.

It's a miracle I ever
actually destroy anything.

Oh, I don't know.

You managed to destroy
just about everything today.

The villains, the heroes,

the lines between them,
my childhood.

Thank you.
I appreciate it, Morty.

I know you were sucking
the Kool-Aid

out of the Vindicators' dicks,

so the fact that I was right
about them

must be pretty hard to admit.

Yeah, it is.
You know why, Rick?

Because when you're an asshole,

it doesn't matter
how right you are.

Nobody wants to give you
the satisfaction.

I know. Everyone wants people
they like to be right.

That's why popular people
are fucking dumb.

And why your pretentious,
poorly written,

high-budget friends back there

can eat a double-decker
shit sandwich.

Disarmed.

Holy shit.
You're jealous.

Yes! Is that
what you want to hear?!

Did it feel good?

Did you like his six million
wriggling legs

more than my tragedy-stricken,

half-ghost,
half-tumescent penis?!

Guys, stop!

You're just proving
my asshole grandpa right!

You wish this was about sex!
We loved each other!

- We had a child together!
- What?!

I conceived a child
with Million Ants,

and it died inside me

because it was half a million
ants and half collapsing star!

And yes.
He was better than you.

- Yeah?
- One million times better.

All aboard, motherfucker!

[ ECHOING ] Stop!

[SCREAMING]

Oof!
Didn't see that coming.

Is that sarcasm?

I don't want you slipping away
when this is over.

All of these deaths
are on your hands.

Okay, come on,
maybe a couple of them,

but definitely
not the Train Guy.

- Oof!
- All of them.

Okay.

<i>-[ DINGING ]
- Congrats. You did it.</i>

<i>All right, by now,
I've been pretty clear</i>

<i>that I think the Vindicators
are [COUGHS] full of shit.</i>

<i>But...you do have one thing
that I'll never have.</i>

<i>And that thing is the only part
of the Vindicators</i>

<i>with any value to me.</i>

<i>If you know what it is,
place it on the platform.</i>

<i>Guess wrong, and the pla-planet
will explode.</i>

<i>And probably the solar system,</i>

<i>'cause I kind of fuckin'
eyeballed the neutrino bombs</i>

<i>on this one.</i>

So what's the trick? Morty,
you're the Drunk Rick expert.

I think...no matter
what we put on there, we die.

He said it's the part
of the Vindicators he values.

That means nothing.

He wants our last moment alive

to be spent knowing
how few fucks he gave.

Jesus! Okay,
open to second opinions.

It could --
It could be Morty.

- What?
- Hey, I don't know.

I mean, look, when I get drunk,

I get stupid and emotional,
and there's no logic to it.

It's, like,
it's possible I got so drunk

I felt like I was losing Morty
to the Vindicators,

and maybe this is
my way of saying, "Okay,

you can have him, but only if
you know how important he is.

Otherwise, I'll kill you."

That is a...
really specific guess.

Look, I-l -- There's
nothing in the room but us.

I'm just using logic
to connect some dots.

It's the best guess I've got.

But you're betting our lives
on it.

I'll cover that bet.
I get it.

Well, Morty, I think
you're doing that smirky face

because you're misinterpreting
the moment.

I am not being coy
about some hidden love for you.

I want to be really clear that
if anyone has a better guess,

like, if I gave you
an amulet last night or --

[DING]

- Phew.
-[ BOTH SIGH ]

[ GASPS ]

Oh, shit.

<i>Sorry. I'm...not good
at goodbyes,</i>

<i>and I'm drunk,
so, you know, I just...</i>

<i>It looks like I'm never
going to see you again.</i>

<i>I can't really roll
with the hero types.</i>

<i>And I don't -- They --
They don't want me around.</i>

<i>But I want you to know, even if
I didn't show it at the time,</i>

<i>I really appreciated
you sticking by me.</i>

<i>God damn it, why am I crying?
It makes no sense.</i>

<i>Ugh, you're</i> --
<i>you're probably confused</i>

<i>because we barely
knew each other,</i>

<i>but you really
stuck your neck out</i>

<i>[BURPS] when you gave me props
for my awesome jokes</i>

<i>in the briefing room.</i>

<i>Everybody else had their head
so far up their ass.</i>

<i>Even my own grandson is like,</i>

<i>"Oh, the Vindicators,
they're so cool."</i>

<i>I mean, he's a moron.
That's their demographic.</i>

<i>But you're different,
Noob Noob.</i>

Motherfucker.

<i>You're fucking cool.
And you're smart.</i>

<i>[ CRYING ] And I bet
we could've hung out and shit.</i>

<i>And I hope you get to be
a full-fledged Vindicator,</i>

<i>and -- and do -- do me a favor.</i>

<i>Don't -- Don't let them know
I-l got emotional.</i>

<i>But you can tell them
one thing.</i>

<i>Tell them I said</i> --

<i>Oh, fuck. Okay. I just
shit myself. Okay, later.</i>

- W-- Dude, Morty, what happened?
- Shut up.

I sense this means
we are not dying.

Not all of us.

-[ BOTH CHOKING]
- Sweetheart.

Just let Titty Bean do this,
Snuzzles.

It's for the greater good.

- Greater good?
- Titty Bean?

It's like you said, Morty.

- There's no right or wrong.
- Never said that.

It's the galaxy's faith
in the Vindicators

that keeps the galaxy secure.

Yeah, I feel safer already.

No doubt. Who do we make
the check out to?

I will say we are getting
some good licks in

-while choking to death --
- Right?

When you came to me,

I was merely

It was your beliefs,
your pursuit of justice

But we can make it simple again.

You were always the romantic.

This is a video game?

But you said
I'm your grandson?

I'm saying everyone is.

Everyone here,
everyone in this world but me.

You're all my grandson,
your name is Morty,

you're stuck in a video game,
and I'm here to get you out.

What about me?
Am I your grandson?

I just said everyone is!

-Wow!
-Incredible!

Okay, okay,
but don't react like that.

It's not a religion.
This is what is happening.

You and me and your sister
are at an arcade

called Blips and Chitz.

It's been taken over
by terrorists.

The power went out,
the game restarted,

and your identity
has been splintered

into all the non-player
characters.

So I jacked in as Roy,
that's the player character,

to get you, my grandson, Morty,

out of the game
before it's over and you die.

Okay, question over here.

Am I your grandson?
Jesus! Yes!

Every single one of you
is one five-billionth of Morty.

All of you,
collectively, are Morty.

Look, I-I don't wanna
seem impatient

but there's actually a lot more
that we have to get done

so if this is
how hard it's gonna be,

we are in a lot of trou--

It's a small group of

Someone to "Help Summer

Fly fishing.
A hug.

A little appreciation for what

of the greatest God damn nation

We're not a person

is expendable.

8% of pizza is crust.

Not for long, baby!

and everyone there was young,
Morty,

and they had been forever.

I was the only old
person there, Morty.

It was [BURPS] like I was some
sort of, you know, celebrity,

walking around.

I-I was fascinating to them.

There were a lot of attractive
women there, Morty, and they...

they... they...
they all wanted time with me.

I had a lot of fun with
a lot of young ladies,

but I spent so much time there,

my interdimensional
portal device...

it's got no charge left, Morty.

It's got no charge left.

What?!

It's as good as garbage, Morty.

It's not gonna
work anymore, Morty.

Oh, geez, Rick, that's not good.

W-what are we gonna do?

I-I have to be back
at school right now.

How are we gonna get back home?

There's ways to
get back home, Morty.

It's just... it's just gonna
be a little bit of a hassle.

We're gonna have to go through
Interdimensional Customs,

so you're gonna have
to do me a real solid.

Uh-oh.

When we get to Customs,

I'm gonna need you to take
these seeds into the bathroom,

and I'm gonna need you
to put them way up

inside your butthole, Morty.

In my butt?

Put them way up inside there,
as far as they can fit.

Oh, geez, Rick.

I really don't want
to have to do that.

Well, somebody's got
to do it, Morty.

Th-these seeds aren't gonna get
through Customs unless they're

in someone's rectum, Morty.

[ WHIMPERS ]

And they'll fall
right out of mine.

I've done this
too many times, Morty.

I mean, you're young.

You've got your whole
life ahead of you,

and your anal cavity is
still taut, yet malleable.

You got to do it
for Grandpa, Morty.

Y-you've got to put these
seeds inside your butt.

In my butt?

Come on, Morty.

Please, Morty.

You have to do it, Morty.

Oh, man.

[ SCHOOL BELL RINGS ]

PRINCIPAL: The fact is, your son, Morty,
has attended this school for a

total of seven hours over
the last two months.

What? Why didn't
you notify us?

I done been notifying you.

Have you not been
getting the messages

I've been leaving with Morty's
grandfather?

Boom!

Told you! Ln your face!

He is ruining our child!

Wait, what am I celebrating?

Yeah, see, I thought
something was fishy there,

because it's usually Morty's
grandpa that's taking

him out of school.

Summer?

[ SOBBING ]
What kind of God lets this happen?

We had a little incident.

A student was frozen to death.

And there's no evidence that
a Latino student did it!

Everyone wants to take
this to a racial place.

I won't let them.

The Glarp Zone is for flarping
and unglarping only.

ALIEN: So, I told him,
"Give me the Blimfarx," you know?

This... this guy...

he doesn't understand
interstellar currency.

It's, like, I'm trying
to eat a Flimflam...

like, that's what
we eat on Girvonesk.

The glarp zone is for
flarping and unglarping only.

I don't like it here, Morty.

I can't abide bureaucracy.

I don't like being told
where to go and what to do.

I consider it a violation.

Did you get those seeds
all the way up your butt?

Yeah, Rick.

Let's just get
this over with, okay?

I mean, these things are pointy.
They hurt.

That means they're good ones.

You're a good kid, Morty.

Those Mega seeds are super
valuable to my work.

You've been a huge help to me.

I'm gonna be able to do [BURPS]
all kinds of things with them.

It's gonna be great, Morty.

[ BURPS ] All kinds of science.

Okay, next through.

Except you. You go over there.

Why does he have
to go over there?

Random check.

He's got to go through
the new machine.

What new... [BURPS]
what new machine?

It's a new machine.

It detects stuff all
the way up your butt.

Run, Morty! Run!

Aah!

Red alert!

I need to type in the coordinates
to our home world, Morty.

Cover me.
- Oh, man.

I mean, you know, I-I
don't want to shoot nobody.

They're just robots, Morty!

It's okay to shoot them!

They're robots!

Aah!

My leg is shot off!

Glenn's bleeding to death!

Someone call his wife
and children!

They're not robots, Rick!

It's a figure of speech, Morty.

They're bureaucrats.

I don't respect them.

Just keep shooting, Morty.

You have no idea what
prison is like here!

Holy crap!
This is insane!

[ CROWD SCREAMING ]

RICK:
Come on, Morty!

We got to get the
hell out of here!

[ ALL GASP ]

Wow.

Did you just come into the
cafeteria through a portal?

Uh, yeah.

Well, you know, my... my
Ferrari's in the shop.

[ CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY ]

Ju... just kidding.

You're Morty, right?
- Yeah.

You can get his number later.

Come on, Morty. We got
to get out of here.

You got to get those
seeds out of your ass.

Oh, look, honey.

It's our son with
Albert Ein-douche.

What?

I'm an angry father,
not an improvisor.

Oh, hi, Jerry.

Oh, my goodness, Morty!

What are you doing out of class?

We talked about this.

Your... your parents and
I are very disappointed in...

in this behavior.

No? No takers?

You guys should really not
be touching that stuff.

It's beyond your reasoning.

You're beyond our reasoning!

Takes one to know one.

Dad, how could you make my
son miss an entire semester of school?

I mean, it's not like
he's a hot girl.

He can't just bail on
his life and set up shop

in someone else's.

What... what are you
guys doing with my stuff?

We're moving you...
to a nursing home.

A nursing home?

What are...
what are you, nuts?

I'm a genius.

I build robots for fun.

Well, now you can build baskets
and watch Paul Newman movies

on VHS and mentally scar the
Boy Scouts every Christmas.

What does that mean?

It's personal.

Dad, mom, c-come on.

Rick just needed my help is all.

Morty, stay out of this.

You are obviously not capable
of judging these situations on your own.

What are you trying
to say about Morty?

That he's stupid or something?

Oh, don't high-road us, Dad.

You know fully well that Morty
is the last child that needs to

be missing classes.

I-I-I don't know what
you mean by that.

Can... can... can you be a
little bit more specific?

Oh, for crying out...

he's got some kind of
disability or something.

Is that what you want us to say?

I do?

Well, duh doy, son.

Look, I love you, Morty, but we
both know you're not as fast as

the other kids, and if you
want to compete in this world,

you got to work twice as hard.

Aw, geez, Dad.

Y-you know, that's a lot
to drop on a kid all at once.

Morty, t-tell your parents
the square root of Pi.

Oh, come on, Rick.

You know I can't.

The square root of Pi,
Morty... go.

1 .77245385.

Whoa!

What the hell?

Holy crap. He's right.

Morty, tell your parents
the first Law of [BURPS]

Thermodynamics.

"The increment in the internal
energy of a system is equal to

the increment of heat
supplied to the system."

Wow! I'm so smart!

But...

I told the both of you...

school is stupid.

It's not how you learn things.

Morty's a gifted child.

He has a special mind.

That's why he's
my little helper.

He's like me.

He's gonna be doing great
science stuff later in his life.

He's too smart for school.

H-he needs to keep hanging out
[BURPS] and helping me.

Jerry, I don't want whatever's
happening here to stop.

No, I-I understand.

Uh, maybe we overreacted.

But he has to keep
going to school.

Okay, Jerry.

You drive a hard bargain,

but [BURPS] what am
I supposed to do?

Say... [BURPS] say no?

You... you really wear
the pants around here.

I just want you to know,
between us, from now on,

it's gonna be 100%
honesty and open,

clear communication.

Frank Palicky was
frozen to death today!

No idea what you're
talking about.

[ SOBBING ]

Okay.

Well, uh, Morty,
it's your bedtime in an hour.

Don't stay up all night again.

This is good, though.

This can work.

I think we can be a family.

And now, Beth,
if you'll have me,

I would love to have you.

You know what?

Okay.

Holy cow, Rick.

I didn't know hanging out with
you was making me smarter.

Full disclosure, Morty...
it's not.

Temporary superintelligence is
just a side effect of the

Mega seeds dissolving in
your rectal cavity.

Aw, man.

Yeah, and once those
seeds [BURPS] wear off,

you're gonna lose most
of your motor skills,

and you're also gonna lose
a significant amount of

brain functionality
for 72 hours, Morty.

Starting [BURPS]
right about now.

Ohh, man.

[ GROANING ]
Oh, geez! Ohh.

I'm sorry, Morty.
It's a bummer.

In reality, you're
as dumb as they come.

And I needed those
seeds real bad,

and I had to give them up just
to get your parents off my back,

so now we're gonna
have to go get more.

And then we're gonna go on even
more adventures after that,

Morty.

And you're gonna keep your mouth
shut about it, Morty,

because the world is full of
idiots that don't understand

what's important,

and they'll tear us apart,
Morty.

But if you stick with me, I'm
gonna accomplish great things,

Morty, and you're gonna be
part of them, and together,

we're gonna run around, Morty.

We're gonna do all kinds of
wonderful things, Morty.

Just you and me, Morty.

Oh, no, no.

The outside world
is our enemy, Morty.

We're the only [BURPS]
friends we've got, Morty.

It's just Rick and Morty...

[BURPS] Rick and Morty
and their adventures, Morty.

Rick and Morty forever
and forever.

Morning, Summer, Beth,

- Gross. What is that thing?
- It's a courier flap.

It's like the intergalactic
version of UPS,

but less off-putting.

Oh, shiiit!

It looks like an egg-vite
from Birdperson.

Must be time
for his annual Oscar party.

And, by the way,

to reach his planet.

This is Birdperson.

And Tammy!

to planet Squanch for

our mate-melding ceremony...
Blugh!

If you're from Earth,

that means
we're getting married!

Oh, my god! My friend Tammy's
marrying Birdperson!

What the hell is a Birdperson?

He's Rick's best friend.

Uh, l-let's not
get carried away, Morty.

Would you like to RSVP
or send a gift?

No. Weddings are basically
funerals with cake.

If I wanted to watch someone
throw their life away,

[BURPS]
I'd hang out with Jerry all day.

Affirmative!
Returning to sender.

No, hold on, stay,

- Staying!
- Dad, you have a friend...

that's getting married.
That's a big deal.

It's a big deal he has a friend.

you and your family

could witness my melding
with Tammy.

Our pleasure.

Yeah, I just hope
you got a pre-meld.

- What?! It's just a practical

way of making sure that
when she's done with you,

you can get
one of your balls back.

- Jesus, Dad.
- He's grumpy from the flight.

Ohh, I-I was happy
on the flight.

I'm grumpy from the landing.

[ SIGHS ] Well, I looked
at the guest book.

We don't know
a damn person here.

Hi! Jerry Smith...
Father of the bride's friend.

Advertising is my usual game,
but I'm between...

Jerry, stop networking.
We're in space.

"Jerry, get a job!

Jerry, don't look for a job
at an alien wedding!"

I don't get you.
This is the closest...

I've ever gotten to this part
of my father's life.

I don't want to blow it.

Okay, I get it.
I'm cramping your style.

You say you get it, but
I'm scared you'll keep doing it.

Look, here's some humans
you can practice on.

You must be
Summer's mom and dad.

We're Tammy's parents...
Pat and Donna Guterman.

Hi. Beth. This is Jerry.

So your teenage daughter's
marrying a Birdman.

Are you guys down with that?

[ CHUCKLES ] No pun intended.

We're quite proud.

He's a wonderful person
and an incredible Bird.

Still, what is he, 40?
[ CHUCKLES ]

It's just, you know,

when he was 30,
she was an actual child.

When he was her age,
she wasn't born.

When he was,
let's see, like, 18,

she was literally
in there in your womb.

Imagine being pregnant
with your daughter

and a Bird teenager
comes into your home and says,

"I'll take that.
I'll have sex with that."

[ BOTH CHUCKLE ]
Give us one second.

Were you born with your feet
in your mouth?

I was transported here
against my will in a meatball, all right.

So take your attitude
to the men's section of KMart,

'cause you need to cut me
some slack... s.

I want you to stand
in the corner

and face the corner
and talk to nobody.

Maybe... I... will.

You know, you're not being
very supportive

of Birdperson on his big day.

Birdperson's big day, Morty,

was at Blood Ridge
on Glapflap's third moon

against the Gromflamites!

This? This is a losing battle.

Geez, Rick,
it's not like he's dying.

He's getting married!

I mean, what do you think's
gonna happen

if you open yourself up
a little bit?

I mean, look around.

This is your family and friends
all around you, you know?

Take the day off.

There's nothing to run from,
nothing to fight.

[ WHISTLES ]
That's his last name.

Are you hyphenating it?

Squanch this, mo-Fo.

[ BOTH LAUGH ]

Good one, Morty.
Excuse me, bartender.

Can you make me
a dumb grandson pep talk?

It's one part lame advice about
stuff you know nothing about

and a lot of vodka.

Mm-Hmm. I have a lot of vodka.

Then I'll take one of those.

I don't need the rest.

God, whatever, Rick.

It sounds like you and my dad
have a long history together.

Wish I could say the same.

The road your father and I
walked together

is soaked deeply with the blood
of both friends and enemies.

Must be nice.

Um, I used to have to draw him

into family photos
with a crayon.

The war in which we fought
is far from over.

We live our lives in hiding.

I guess I should
be happy for you.

I mean, great,
you guys got to hang out.

I hope you had a blast.

The galactic government
considers us terrorists.

It's unwise of me
to share these details,

but I've become inebriated.

I don't know
if you can appreciate

what it means to grow up
without a father, but...

The guest list at this wedding

includes 17 of the Federation's
most wanted.

We have committed
numerous atrocities

in the name of freedom.

Annnd during that time,

I don't suppose he
ever mentioned his daughter.

Are those baby quiches?

I should prepare
for the ceremony.

Like talking to a brick wall.

and my lack of cats.

Uh, hi, everybody.

I'm Ri[BURPS]ck.

You know, when I first
met Birdperson, he was, uhh...

Listen, I'm not the nicest guy
in the universe

because I'm the smartest.

And being nice is something
stupid people do

to hedge their bets.

Now, I haven't been
exactly subtle

about how little
I trust marriage.

I couldn't make it work,

and I could turn a black hole
into a sun,

so at a certain point,
you got to ask yourself

what are the odds this is legit

and not just some big lie
we're all telling ourselves

because we're afraid
to die alone?

Because, you know, that's
exactly how we all die... alone.

- Oh, boy.
- Oh, Dad.

and if he loves Tammy, well,
then I love Tammy, too.

you're a high-School senior"

from the planet Earth,
and you're marrying

"a 40-year-old Birdperson?

[ LAUGHTER ]

Yeah, Tammy!

But then I think, you know,
in a lot of ways,

I'm not a high-School senior
from the planet Earth.

In a lot of ways,
what I really am

is a deep-cover agent
for the Galactic Federation,

and you guys are

and this entire building is,
in a certain sense, surrounded.

you'd like to tell us

about your relationship

with this previously unknown
galactic government?

seem pretty clear, no?

They think they control
the galaxy, I disagree.

Don't hate the player,
hate the game, son.

How could you be so dishonest
with this family?

more open and trusting

and loving like,
oh, I don't know,

Or your daughter,

who is BFFs

- And now we know why.

and fuck me
for letting my guard down,

which I will never do again.

under your nuts and or labia

and hook them up
to an alien car battery

on this planet?

Uh, computer, how long
are the days on this planet?

[ SCREAMING CONTINUES ]

42 hours.

All right, well,
those are the two choices,

'cause cob planet is
off the table.

Now let's take a vote.

MAN: Well, it's official.

The obscure planet
known as Earth,

formerly the hiding place
of interstellar terrorist

and fugitive Rick Sanchez,

has just become
the 6,048th planet

to join the Galactic Federation.

The plucky little ball
of water and dirt,

which is where it gets its name,

is dominated by seven billion
primate-descended natives

who love to eat spaghetti
and pray to kangaroos.

Spaghetti, kangaroos?
I've gotta check this place out.

[BOTH LAUGH] Well, you can.

Contact the Ministry of Tourism
for details.

Up next,
teenagers are calling it

[GROWLS AND SQUEALS]

And it's not what you think.

What are you...
What did you do that for?

Dramatic effect.

Good morning, family.
Oh, do I smell bacon?

Yes, we discovered
a species of tiny pig

off the coast of New Australia

about 30 yards east.
Or 300 yards west.

We'd offer you some,

but we hunted it to extinction
for breakfast.

Well, I thought
I'd walk to the South Pole

and do a little bit
of exploring.

If you guys need me, just yell

or throw something so hard

that it goes around the world
and hits me.

[ DOOR SHUTS ]
Okay, now that he's gone,

can we please talk about
our situation?

Dad, you can't talk about people
behind their back.

You know, it's a small world.

Please, he's in the South Pole!

And we need to have
a serious conversation.

[ INSECTS CHIRPING ]

[ THUNDER RUMBLES ]

[ WIND HOWLING ]

South Pole discovered, baby!

Ohhhh!

Oh fuck! An ice cave?

Shit!

Things just keep on
getting better.

Wow, it's the planet's core.

JERRY: I'm just saying,

we keep acting
like there's only two options,

but there's not.

So, yes, if we went
back to Earth,

as long as Rick was out there,
they'd wanna interrogate us.

But, and this is
purely hypothetical,

what if we turned your father in
to the government?

Jerry, so help me god,

if you ever bring this up again,
no more bacon.

There already is no more bacon!

This world sucks!
Our life sucks!

Why are we doing this
for someone

that would never do anything
for anyone but himself?

MORTY:
That's not the point, Dad!

We love Rick...
f-for the most part.

SUMMER: Yeah, you don't love
people in hopes of a reward,

Dad, you love them
unconditionally.

That's very good, kids.
I'm proud of you.

Okay, so let me
get this straight.

For the rest of your lives,

no matter how much it hurts you,

no matter how much it
destroys our children's futures,

we're gonna do whatever
Rick wants, whenever he wants?

- ALL: Yes.
- Why?!

Because I don't want him to
leave again, you dumb asshole!!

Hey. Uh...

I was gonna hope over
to the Gloppydrop system,

get some ice cream.

You... You want me to come with?

Don't you need my brain waves
for camouflage or something?

I'll be okay. Bye, Morty.

Rick?

You're not leaving, right?

Yeah, I am. To get ice cream.

So, you're coming back?

Morty, if you go to where
there's a bunch of ice cream

and then you don't come back,

you haven't
actually gotten ice cream,

you've just gone
where ice cream is.

Rick, I can handle it if you go,

but you'll break Mom's heart.

And I won't forgive you
for that.

Where's the van, Morty?

It's over the horizon
in the driveway.

We got to go!
You got to come with me, Jerry!

- Rick?
- It's important, Jerry.

[BURPS] The fate of the galaxy
rests on your shoulders.

Let's go.
Put some pants on.

N-Never mind, there's no time
for pants, Jerry.

I'll make you a pair of pants
on the way.

It's a Rick and Jerry adventure!

Rick and Jerry episode!

[DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYS]

Then I thought,
"Hey, what about Jerry?

He's -- He's good
with regular folk."

This is a real situation
where -- where --

where Jerry could really shine.

He's a master convincer."

Rick, I'm not an idiot.
I know what this is.

Oh. Okay, well, I told Morty,

"Look, parents get divorced.
They get sad. He'll be fine,"

but I think he's worried
you're gonna, you know...Pbht!

And you know how Morty gets
when he gets emotional.

It impedes my work.

So, I told him I'd take you out
and give you a win.

Wait. My son asked you
to take me

On some kind of pity adventure
to keep me from killing myself?

Wait, w-what
did you think it was?

An execution.

Geez!
You really do need a win.

No!
I-l don't know.

I mean, you never made me
the pants, so --

So, you thought
I was gonna drive you

into the middle of the galaxy
and shove you

into the vacuum of space
with your dick hanging out?

And we're seeing how you'd act
if that were about to happen?

I mean, shit, I'll make you
the pants right now.

Take me two seconds
to make you pants.

- I have pants at home!
- Jerry, if I make pants,

they'll be better than
your pants at home.

Also, if I wanted to kill you --

Yeah, I get it.
It'd be amazing.

Please, take me home.

I'll tell my son we had
an amazing adventure.

Well, if it's all the same,

could we go
get our story straight?

Because you're a terrible liar.

You called me
a master convincer!

You believed me?

Huh. This seems...kind of fancy.

Jerry, for all you know,
this is the equivalent

of an alien truck stop.

You have no frame of reference.

You're in a universe
beyond your imagining.

But, yes, it is super fancy.

I mean, my job here is
to make Morty happy.

I'm not gonna take you
somewhere dangerous.

-[ GRUNTS]
- Rick Sanchez.

I told you if I ever saw
your face in here again,

I would stick you
like the pig you are.

[COUGHS] Shnoopy Bloopers,
I told you if you tried...

there'd be two funerals.

Aaah!

Someone?

Uh, someone?
Someone!

to see you again, buddy!

- Yeah, you're doing it.

Mr. Sanchez gets
anything he wants!

The resort's covered
in an immortality field.

You can't die here.
That's the gimmick.

[LAUGHING]

Okay, but still --
bad parenting.

Hey, rich a-holes
are rich a-holes.

They all pay top dollar
to come here

and enjoy a consequence-free
vacation.

No death, no disease,
no dismemberment.

-[ GRUNTING ]
- Can't even have a heart attack.

Got it.
The perfect place

to take the most fragile being
in the universe.

I can tell you expect me
to refute that,

but it's right on the money.

If I come home without you,

I doubt Morty's gonna
let me off the hook.

Yeah, but what if you came home
with Jeff Goldblum?

Jeff Goldblum? What the fuck
are you talking about, Jerry?

[SPITS] Jesus!

Holy fucking shit!

Yo, what's up, "Big Chill"?!

Don't go into that telepod!

[BOTH LAUGHING]

Hey, maybe we would have fun
on a fake adventure.

On a <i>fake</i> adventure.

Speaking of,
what are we gonna tell Morty?

I don't know.
But whatever it is,

we're gonna need a couple more
of these babies!

[CLINK! ]

-[ SOBBING ]
- What's wrong?

[CRYING] Mom,
do you think I'm hot?

I...don't think that's something
that matters.

So, I'm not hot?!

I'm saying the part of you
that cares about that

is a part you shouldn't
give any energy to.

That's not an answer!

Because I'm not an issue
of Cosmo, okay?

I'm your mother
and a doctor, and --

I'm hideous!

[SOBBING]

Geez.
What's with her?

Teenage-girl stuff.

Is that a...hoof collage?

It's perfectly legal,
if that's what you're wondering.

Cool...zies.

"We just don't have anything
in common anymore, Summer."

Oh, yeah, Ethan?

What do you have in common
with Tricia Lange?

A mutual love of French cinema?

The belief that a carbon tax

is the only viable solution
to climate change?

Or could it be
her massive stripper titties?!

[GASPS]
There it is.

Boob-ya!

And that's when
Malakai the Squid King

rips off his face,
and beneath it is my face.

- I liked it.
- Thank you, sir.

Yeah, of course he likes it.
Look at him.

Motherfucker got two heads
and three trunks.

All right,
we'll put a pin in it.

I'm gonna go take a leak.

[WHISTLING]

What the...

[GRUNTING]

Ah! My hands are dry!
My hands are dry!

My name is Risotto Groupon.

I am the assistant general
manager of the restaurant.

Do you have any comment cards?

Because I might have
some thoughts.

My kingdom was usurped by force
with weapons and technology

supplied by
<i>your</i> father-in-law!

Hey, he usurped
my kingdom, too, man.

He basically got me kicked out
of my home, stole my family.

Then we are brothers,
and you have wondered

what your life could have been
without Rick.

Wondered? Sure.

I mean, I've wondered
about having a vagina.

Would you help me kill him?

What? No!

He's my wife's father.
Move on.

Do you...like theme-park rides?

Oh, you really moved on.

There is a popular attraction
here called the Whirly Dirly.

Between the first whirly
and the third dirly,

the ride dips just outside
the immortality field.

You're asking me to lure Rick
to his death?

I'm only asking you
to go on a ride with Rick,

get off the ride without Rick,
and go home to your family,

where you can...
wonder about having a vagina.

Okay, okay, that was
a very specific example

pulled from thin air.

I don't want to be known
as the vagina guy.

Risotto, you're needed.
Someone ordered

the Nuzzy Guzzy Fresh
and Fluzzy Special.

[SIGHS DEJECTEDLY]
Look, I'm not like Rick,

so you're free to do
as you please.

But there comes a time
in every man's life

when he must choose
the foundation

on which his legacy
will be built --

one of compromise
or one of blood.

We can't just call your grandpa

whenever there's a problem.

We can handle this ourselves.

in trying to.

What, you don't think
I have a shot?

I didn't say that.

Excuse me.
May I have another one of these?

Coming right up.

Hmm, things weren't always
so bad between Beth and me.

We had some good times
when we were younger.

Oh, yeah, I bet.

That's how teenage pregnancy
happens, my friend.

Yeah, no.
[CHUCKLES]

Things were pretty great, even
until a couple of years ago.

Jerry, I get it.

That's around the time
I moved in with you guys.

Oh, I guess you're right.

Jerry, you know,
I hope you're not suggesting

that I had anything to do
with your marriage breaking up,

because there are some major
issues between you and Beth

that have been there
since you guys met.

Hey, to new beginnings.

To the Whirly Dirly.

The Whirly Dirly?

All right, what's going on here?

When did you get cool?!

- Aha, look at this.

But...if the machine was made

normal would mean eight legs.

go on another spiel

will make her normal.

- She's huge!
- And normal!

- I'm not normal!
- Mom!

that's a good idea.

could "reverse" possibly mean?

I put a lot of strain
on your marriage.

It wasn't fair.
I'm sorry.

- What?!
- I didn't respect your marriage.

I certainly
didn't do it any favors.

And for what it's worth,

I'll apologize to Beth for it
when we get home.

We had a deal, Jerry Smith.

It's a really common name.

Now, take it easy, Rick.

You've been in a serious
roller-coaster crash.

It's -- It's no time
to be thinking about

who did or didn't play a role
in your attempted murder.

[SCREAMS] Get it off me!
It's eating me!

Look, I confess, okay?

They told me about all the
bad stuff you did to this planet

and reminded me of all
the bad stuff you did to me.

But then you said
you were sorry, and I realized

you're not a monster --
not like this thing.

Fuck!
It's got me good.

This is a mislead, right?

You're inventing a thing
to save me.

That would be called
a knife, Jerry.

It's been invented.

I'm making a way out of here.
One seat ought to do it.

I'm sorry.
I-l made a mistake.

- I won't do it again!
- Nobody ever does.

[GRUNTING]

You self-righteous
piece of shit!

You took my family!

I took <i>your</i> family?

Who do you think
had more taken from them

when you shot 20cc of liquid
dream-killer into my daughter?

She was <i>Rick's</i> daughter, Jerry.
She had options!

Oof.

That all ended
because she felt sorry for you.

You act like prey,
but you're a predator!

You use pity to lure in
your victims!

That's how you survive!

I survive
because I know everything.

That snakes survives
because children wander off,

and you survive
because people think,

"Oh, this poor piece of shit.
He never gets a break.

I can't stand
the deafening silent wails

of his wilting soul.

I guess I'll hire him
or marry him."

Rick!
[MUFFLED] Rick!

I knew you wouldn't let me die.

That was never an option.

Because you never had a son.

No, because I need
a living organism

coated in gibble snake bile
to attract a shmooglite runner.

- Wait, what's happening?
- Use that confusion, Jerry.

It'll make you wriggle more like
an abandoned newborn.

-[ LOW GROWLING]

- I do.
- Give that button a push.

- Morty!
- Don't "Morty" me!

I could get a break

from this kind of shit, but no!

and just as irresponsible!

dangerous people from flights.

buy a ticket, right?

Otherwise, the terrorists win.

Her mother's gonna be Jessica.

Wait, when did Summer
ask you that?!

Right before she Clive Barkered
herself. Why?

Wait, I know where she is!

Ethan and Summer were
supposed to go camping,

and then he dumped Summer
for this girl Tricia Lange,

who's got huge boobies,
and took her.

Campsite -- The one with the
name that sounds like somebody

gave up halfway
through naming it.

Uh...Camp Flabanabba!

Mama's coming, baby.

Mama's coming, and she cares
about your titties!

They have
sweet smiggle honey cookies.

Mmm! And low-calorie
petroleum flakes.

Obviously cookies.

Let's get you the flakes, then.

Okay, but it's not
what I wanted.

Well, maybe next time,
you won't be

such a dumb piece of shit
and you can pick for yourself.

- That's not nice.
- What's that?

Did you just have
a controversial thought?

- No.
- That's what I thought, bitch.

You little punk-ass.

[CHUCKLES]
This is the best.

I agree.
You've made things even easier

than if you hadn't
been incompetent.

Uh-oh.
We get shoot-shoot now.

<i>MAN". All right, folks, if you
could please take your seats,</i>

<i>we're about to enter

<i>So, I hope everybody bought
a dinner first.</i>

-[ CHUCKLES] Nice.
- Nice.

-[ GRUNTS ]
- Jerry, step over there

and lock yourself
in the escape pod.

- You're not killing us?
- I'm killing Rick.

You're free to go. You're
no threat to me or anyone.

Now you're just being mean.

Yeah, you're mean!
No offense.

Mean would be
shooting you, Jerry.

This is saving a bullet.

Go back to
your quietly ashamed family

and live out
the rest of your days

in denial
of your vagina fantasies.

It was a one-time thought
that everyone has!

[GRUNTING]

What are you doing?

I'm being triumphantly brave!

It's not triumphant or brave.

You're not risking anything.

You might shoot me.

I think you know I won't.

Because you know
I feel sorry for you.

You're just doing this
so you can tell yourself

you fought -- Ow!

Congratulations, Jerry.
You get to die a man.

Whoa!
What is happening to me?

Where is this?
Where am I?

Am I dead?

Who am I?

I'm time!
I'm literally time!

ALL:
VVhooooa!

Aah!

Oh, God. I feel like
our souls were united,

and we were all one
with eternity.

Our body's unchanged,

yet our minds have lived
a thousand lifetimes.

Is that enough time
for me to forgive you?

I don't know,
but it's enough time

for a synaptic dampener
to wear off.

[POP]

Jesus!

He hadn't decided
he was still going to kill us!

He was talking himself into it.
I've seen it before.

Cosmic apotheosis wears off
faster than salvia.

I'm starting to believe you
because I just finished merging

with your essence
for an endless epoch,

and I'm already back to thinking
you're an asshole.

Fine with me.
Let's just go our separate ways.

Sounds like you
and the word "epoch"

have a lot of catching up to do.

Wait, don't leave me!

you're free to get up</i>

<i>and maybe take the wormhole out
for breakfast.</i>

MAN <i>#2: Okay,
you can do the dinner one</i>

<i>or the breakfast one,
but not both.</i>

You think you got that thing
figured out?

Yeah, I know what I'm doing.

BETH: Good.
Because I have an idea.

It's actually a contraction
of "some" and "more."

Summer got into

messed around, and
turned herself into a monster.

My mom did the same
to make her feel better.

She's a good mom.

Uh, I guess we better
get on the same page

about our fake adventure.

- Right.

I'll leave out the part
where you tried to murder me...

And I'll leave out the part

where you admitted
to sabotaging our marriage.

You want to...

Nah, if the family
sees me like this,

they'll feel sorry for me.

Which is no longer
my signature move.

I don't have my wallet,

[ INDISTINCT CONVERSATION]

All right.
All right, all right.

- Mr. President.
- It's about time, gentlemen.

Rick, do you need
to drink in here?

- Yes.
- Here's the adventure.

Some kind of alien...googa

has infested
the Kennedy Sex Tunnels.

I want it hunted down
and taken out.

Kennedy Sex Tunnels?

Naturally, you'll forget
you saw them,

along with, in order of
national embarrassment,

the Truman Cocaine Lounge,
the McKinley Hooker Dump,

and the Lincoln Slave Coliseum.

He didn't free them all.

And let me know
when you're done.

Maybe then we could
get a selfie?

Too busy, Morty.
Now tell me about this summit.

Is it a peace one
or a regular one?

[ BEEPING ]

[GROWLING]

[ZAP! ZAP! ZAP!]

[WHIMPERS]

Ugh. This sucks.

God, tell me about it.

Oh, man.
If you're not into it --

What do you mean?
Why would I be into it?

- It's lame.
- You're into lame stuff, Morty.

I thought young dumb people
considered it an honor

to work for presidents
or whatever the shit.

Maybe the first few times,
but this just sucks.

He treats us like Ghostbusters.

- We should talk to him.
- Yeah, that sounds fun.

Let's set some boundaries
with a spoiled control freak

that thinks he runs the world

and orders drone strikes
to cope with his insecurity.

It's either that
or more of this.

Third choice...

-"Minecraft."
- You like it now?

Got to be honest, Morty.
It's growing on me.

Notify the president.

- What do I tell him?
- Tell him the truth.

Tell him Rick and Morty
just blew off America.

[DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYS]

MORTY: You can use that wood
to make a chest.

RICK: Oh, good. Then I can
store all this wood

I'll need later
for chest-making.

MORTY: Okay. You're not
going to have fun

if you analyze everything.

This is what they'd rather do?

It's all in the transcript.

"Treats us like Ghostbusters."

So, Ghostbusters
aren't cool now?

I don't recall
signing that bill.

"Control freak."

"Orders drone strikes
to cope with..."

"insecurity."

Should we drone-strike them?

- That would prove him right!
- And blow him up.

Give me the phone.

RICK: Is this game popular
with autistic people?

Why would you say
something like that?

'Cause I'm starting to love it.

[CELLPHONE VIBRATING]

MORTY: "Failure to answer
is a felony offense"?

RICK:
Play it cool.

As far as he knows,
we're still in the tunnels.

SECRETARY OF DEFENSE:
[CHUCKLES]

When should we reveal
we can see them?

We're holding all
the cards right now.

We don't show any before
the time is right.

- Awesome.
- RICK: Yello?

Hi, guys.
U.S. President calling.

- How's it going?
- Oh, hey.

Just hard at work
on this sex tunnel gagoo.

I think it's kind of our
new archnemesis, you know?

It might take a while.

What do you think, Morty,
a month?

Fingers crossed, a month, yeah.

You lying dicks!

I see your asses playing
"Minecraft"!

I got you on satellite!

That's right.

What do you have to say
for yourselves?

Okay, obviously,
this looks bad, Mr. President.

I mean, what doesn't look bad

through an illegal
spy satellite?

Don't high-road me.

The two of you break
1,000 federal laws a day.

- Wow, really?
- That's pretty cool.

And, yes, yes, yes, yes,
you save the world now and then.

America returns that favor

by not holding the two of you
accountable to its laws.

- Oh!
- Oh! on, God.

We -- We didn't know
you saw it that way.

Well, it's nobody's fault.

We never had "the talk,"
so to speak.

RICK: Yeah. I mean,
the way we see it,

when we show up,
that's the favor to you.

Especially, you know,
when it turns out

you wanted someone to come over
just because you found

an "X-Files" monster
in your basement.

As for the reason you've never,
like, arrested us,

we assumed you just knew
that it was impossible,

like, if you tried.

You know, it wouldn't go well.

Wouldn't go well?
Can you elaborate?

I think one of your 1,000 laws
says, no, I can't elaborate.

Just trust me.
None of us want to go there.

Which we'll never have to.

By the way, we'll keep on
saving the Earth.

You know, we're --
we're happy to do that.

RICK: Yeah, but not because
it contains America --

because moving to a new version
of Earth is a bitch and a half.

But feel free to call us, you
know, as -- as, like, friends.

Yeah, like, if you ever
want to take a selfie --

So, are we cool?

PRESIDENT: Yes.
Thank you, gentlemen.

I told you, man!

I'm impressed, Morty.
That went really well.

[ INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS]

Everybody,
get ahold of yourselves!

Sir, what is our new
Rick and Morty policy?

Our policy is, we never needed
them and never will again.

Today, we celebrate
our independence

from Rick and Morty.

Not needed here. You can leave

Have you never heard

Do you even know how to take out

We're not taking it out.

We're going to shrink down and

I could, like, leave Earth
and wander the infinite cosmos

to figure out who I am and that
nobody would ever know I'd left

because you could
replace me with a clone?

- Mm-hmm.
- Am I the clone?

- Sorry. What?
- Am I the clone?

Did the real me choose to leave,
and I only think I chose to stay

because that's
what I need to think

because I'm
the replacement Beth?

- No.
- Okay.

Wait.
And one more thing.

If I were a clone,
would you tell me?

Beth, you know, when --
when smart people get happy,

they stop recognizing
themselves.

And you are very smart because
you're very much my daughter.

Oh, God. You're right.
I'm sorry.

- Thank you, Dad.
- All good?

Totally.
I'm fine now.

And just to be sure,

you're not pretending
to be convinced you're real

because you're actually
convinced you're a clone

and you're now terrified
that becoming self-aware

would mean I'd have to
terminate you?

- No.

See you soon.

[SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYS]

I am Presidentress
of the Mega Gargantuans.

We named ourselves
before learning we were small.

Madam Presidentress,
I'm President of America,

which is basically the world,

but you didn't hear that
from me.

- I've come to --
- I know who you are.

We've already agreed
to a ceasefire

with your ambassadors,
Rick and Morty.

- Rick and Morty were here?
- Of course they were here.

They can shrink instantly
and teleport.

They told me to give you this.

They said it will stretch
as your cancer pill wears off

and your body awkwardly enlarges
at the rate of a '50s movie.

Are there pants?

They said you'd prefer
just a shirt.

Apparently, you have a need
to swing your dick around?

Rick and Morty escaped.

No shit.
Take me to the Pentagon.

We're at war
with Rick and Morty.

You'll want to make a stop
at the White House?

I have pants at the Pentagon,
Rhonda. It's in my contract.

I mean you need to call
a press conference.

Israel and Palestine have
announced a permanent ceasefire.

- What?
- They signed something called

"The Pretty Obvious If You
Think About It" accord.

Apparently, an anonymous
American diplomat

took them
to a "Star Wars" cantina,

where they smoked
perspective-enhancing

alien pheromones
through a laser hookah.

I still say it has to be Putin.

It was Rick and Morty,
you fucking dunce!

But you're getting
the credit, sir.

Your approval rating
just hit 100%.

Why would Rick
and Morty want that?

Because they're assholes!

I'm flattered,
but it takes a whole team

to achieve what we did today.

Thank you.

Well?

They haven't been
back home, sir.

We've got every possible
location under surveillance.

God damn it!
They're right here!

- They're here, God damn it!
- Code Red! We need backup!

Everybody relax.

Just waiting for you
in the only room

you can't blow up or spy on.

So, we're not changing
timelines for you,

but now you have
everything you want,

so you can forget we exist,
and we'll return the favor.

You couldn't say that in a text?

Well, since we won't be seeing
each other again, my --

Guys, we get it.
It's a Code Red. Enough.

My grandson has
worked hard for you,

and I feel like
he's earned a selfie.

Honestly, I could take it
or leave it at this point.

You're taking it.

No. What kind of fratty-ass
status move is that?

Get out of my office!

Seriously?
You're that stubborn?

He's the stubborn one.
I'm protecting my country.

Uh, from selfies?

From subordination
to hostile powers.

Uh, does China know about
that deal-breaker?

China doesn't piss
on the White House.

Well, why would they?
I'm sure it was expensive.

- Get out.
- Not without a selfie.

Arrest them.

Son, you have a right
to refuse his order,

and I guarantee you're going to
die if you touch me,

and there's no afterlife.
Everything just goes black.

Don't do it.

- Whoa, Rick!
- Okay. What was that?

- Death.
- What kind?

-Instant.
- There was no sound.

- He just died.
- Yeah, terrifying.

It's a terrifying thing
to watch happen.

It's called a deterrent.

You couldn't
just knock him out?

How is knocking out a deterrent?

Everyone wants to be
knocked out.

Nobody wants to be dead.

You committed murder
in the Oval Office.

- Now you can't leave.
- That's fine.

I said I'm not leaving
without a selfie.

Uh, I don't need a selfie.

And I'm saying
you aren't getting one

and you aren't leaving.

- So we agree?
- Yes. No. We disagree

because you think you're getting
a selfie and leaving.

Am I getting a selfie?

- Never.
- Then I'm never leaving.

- Exactly.
- See?

Does anyone have a shot?

Yes, nine people.
I can show you.

- But I wouldn't recommend --
- Open fire!

God, you are dumb!

Get the President out of here!

- Bad idea.
- Wait. Why?

Because if there isn't
someone in here

that they're not
supposed to kill,

they're going to wreck
the place trying to kill me.

As long as you live,
no matter where you are,

if it isn't in a selfie
with him, I'll be here.

Jesus!
He's not a fucking god!

You don't know what I am!

And you don't know
what I can do!

Geez, it's -- it's cool, Rick!

I'm Doctor Who
in this motherfucker.

I could be a clone.
I could be a hologram.

We could be clones
controlled by robots

controlled with special headsets

that the real Rick and Morty
are wearing

while they're fucking
your mother!

I'm going to kill you!

Then come to 312 Olive Street!

Is that her address?

because right now

I'd love to understand
how I can help you.

I can't be in charge
of that, Jerry.

You know me inside and out.

Okay. Sit down.

Now cross your legs.

Oh, what is this?

<i>[CLASSICAL MUSIC PLAYS]</i>

Senior year,
I took you on a date

to the Milwaukee
Symphony Orchestra

performing the music
of Alan Silvestri in the Park.

At this point in the song
from "Volcano,"

when Tommy Lee Jones
and the utility workers

are using cars to guide
the lava into a cul-de-sac,

I realized my palms
were so sweaty,

I would never get
to hold your hand.

But I was desperate
to touch you,

so I wiped my palm
on the grass next to me.

But a Snickers wrapper
kind of got stuck on it,

so I started
kind of jiggling it,

whipping it without
moving too much.

But you started looking over,
and I thought,

"Well, this is it. She's going
to see that I'm a loser,

and I'll never get
to touch her.

But I still have time
to touch her."

But my hand had Snickers
on it,

and the brass section
was swelling

because it was the scene with
the guy melting in the lava.

And I just thought, "Fuck it.
Lips don't sweat."

Wow. Yeah.

I'll never forget that feeling.

You're the real thing.

Then that settles it,

because my memory
is of hating that night.

But now, reliving it,
all I can feel is how lucky I am

to be loved by such a simple,
honest, simple man.

Simple twice.

This isn't the woman
you married, Jerry,

because this woman loves you.

Oh, for Christ's sake.

are getting back together.

matter if she is or isn't

because now she loves my dad,

can't coexist

with a living god

in Area 51 already,

so that doesn't really count.

I told you
we shouldn't have gone

to the same cabin
as last time!

Oh, we're not going anywhere.
This ends now.

Dad, if you're my dad.
Of course, you're not my dad.

You're here with a gun
because I am a clone.

I guess I have all
your daughter's memories.

So I guess I was her,
which makes me related to her.

But I don't relate to her.

She left her family and me,
which means I relate to them.

So if you kill me, fine.
You're not killing her.

But you're killing
a real family.

And instead of doing that,
will you just go away?

Aren't there, like,
infinite timelines?

Can't you just move to one
where I don't know I'm a clone

and where a different
but identical version

of your authentic
sociopathic crazy bitch

of a daughter can keep
making you proud

by being somewhere else?

You're my daughter.

I brought this here
to kill Jerry.

from digging into everything
and everyone around you

and draining them of
any ability to fend you off.

Well, it couldn't have been
easy for you to say that.

I appreciate it.

Morty, where's my portal gun?
Let's get out of here.

I'm staying here, Rick.

Are you -- Ugh!

Nobody gets it.

Nothing you think matters
matters.

This isn't special.

This -- This is happening
infinite times

across infinite realities.

Including this?
[ FARTS]

Yes!

Which is not to say that,
subjectively, it wasn't funny.

Are you going to stay?

There's infinite
timelines, Morty.

Why would I stay in the one
where I trashed the White House,

became an enemy of America

and the lowest-status character
in my idiot family?

Because of the fart?

There's still some rubble
over there.

I don't think you've
ever understood

what "Secretary of the interior"
means!

Hi, Mr. President.
I'm Rick Sanchez,

but not the one that did this.

We Ricks travel the infinite and
switch places with each other

like hermit crabs, I think.

I'm Fly Fishing Rick.

You can distinguish me
from the Rick

that you had a falling-out with

by my fly-fishing enthusiasm
and accompanying hat.

I hope I can be of service

if, uh, you ever find
the planet to be in danger.

Ff lends?

Sounds good to me.

Kids, dinner!

I got Panda Express!

Did you get sugar chicken?

That's kind of the only
thing they have.

I love Panda E!
Thanks, Mom!

I'm hoping to get a piece
of your sugar chicken later.

[LAUGHS] Stop it.

Here's your [BURPS]
stupid hat, dipshit.

Dad, you can't talk to Jerry
that way anymore.

We're a real family now.

In many ways, things
will be like Season 
but more streamlined.

Now Jerry and I are
happily married parents,

and the idea
that I was motivated

by a fear of you leaving
can be eschewed.

Eschewed?
You've never used that word.

Maybe you are a clone.

[LAUGHS] It's not like
Rick would tell us.

[ LAUGHTER]

[DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYS]

Ooh-wee!
What a season!

Sorry I never showed up,
but I got married.

I had a baby.

I went back to school
and got my G-E-E-E-D.

What did you do
while you were waiting?

Hopefully you didn't just fuck
around and waste your life.

Ooh-wee!

See you for Season 4 in,
like, a really long time!

I might even have
a big white Santa Claus beard

and -- and -- and a --

and a couple of grandkids

And all that kind of stuff.

See you -- See you then!

﻿Ah! Now, that was some
fantastic chow mein.

And before you say
that sounded racist,

you can ask the waiter
how they say it.

It's Panda Express, honey.
The waiter's from Portland.

Alright, who the hell
changed my ringtone

to the theme from "Taxi"?

It's a new thing on Taxi Tok.

That's a subculture
on TikTok of kids

who decided the theme
from "Taxi" slaps.

Now you have to play
the "Taxi" theme

for ten people
while I film it.

I don't have to do shit.
That's dumb.

It raises awareness
for leukemia.

So...who else is excited
for the zoo tomorrow?

Zoos are my favorite
kind of non-water park.

It's just a shame that
they both give you diarrhea.

You only get diarrhea at the zoo
if you eat the food

you're supposed to feed
to the animals.

Which you've done, twice.

They put it
in gumball machines.

You know, fortune cookies
only come true

if you eat the cookie
first.

Alright. "Hard work
often pays off"? Lame.

"Family time
is time well spent."

Okay, that's not only empty.
It's been disproven.

Okay, mine says,
"Family time is time well..."

Oh, man,
I got the same one?

-Boo.
-Boo.

What's your stupid
21-century

watered-down
fortune cookie say, Dad?

"You will have sex
with your mother."

Fortune cookies
aren't legitimate, right?

Jerry, are you
seriously asking

if I think you're gonna
have sex with your mom?

No, I-I wanted to ask
if it's okay with you

if I make myself
throw up the cookie.

If it makes you feel better and
you can do it quietly, yes,

but don't hand that advice
down to Summer.

Ugh! Can't do it.

Sleepy Gary ruined
my gag reflex,

which is frustrating
because Sleepy Gary wasn't real.

Neither are fortune cookies.
Go to sleep, Jerry.

I know they're not real.

It's just --
why is it so specific?

And why are three
of the numbers

a few numbers off
from my Mom's birthday?!

Can we investigate this,
Rick?

It's not an X-File, Jerry,

You got the world's
last interesting fortune.

Dad, can you explain to TikTok
what's going on with your mom?

Summer,
no social videoing!

What if Mi-Maw sees it?

We can't let her know this
is a thing that might happen!

Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Uh, "might"?

She's calling again.

She doesn't usually
call this much.

Because you don't
usually ghost her

because you don't usually
decide you're at risk of...

What if she's calling me
to tell me I'm adopted?!

Well, yeah, then you
should definitely hit that.

That's not funny!

Jerry, you're making it funny
by taking it seriously.

And none of us
will be laughing

if you let this
ruin our zoo trip.

Rick, can you use science to
make it impossible for me to --

Jerry, you're
insulting science.

And as the most powerful
man in the universe,

if I create technology to
prevent a random occurrence,

I'll end up making it
more possible than random.

When do we leave
for the zoo?

One hour. You have one hour
to let go of this.

I'm already done
thinking about it.

Check that out, huh?

Ah! Ah! No!

Aah! Aah! Aah!

Let me out! Let me out!

-You have ten seconds.
-I want to go.

You know of my love
for the zoo!

Why are you dressed
like Morty?

Because Morty's mom
is Beth.

I'm not unpacking that.

Okay, if you think I have
this much patience for the zoo,

on Earth,
you're sorely mistaken.

Jerry, if you don't come with
us, I will be so disappointed.

Okay, you guys should
probably go on without Jerry.

I just took some readings
on his probability field,

and this fortune
has some strange powers

I'm gonna need
to investigate.

Really?!
Oh, God, I knew it.

Okay. Well.
Be careful, honey.

Ooh! Bring me back a handful
of zebra snacks?

A-And please take pictures
with my favorite animal,

the white tiger!

Because
they breed via incest?

Is that true?!

Ah. I knew I was right.
Not even close.

I just didn't want to
see someone get bullied
into going to a zoo.

You may be the single
dumbest human I've ever met,

Jerry,
but you still have a right

to take whatever
you want seriously.

Thank you,
but if that thing says

I'm not gonna do it with my mom,
I can go to the zoo.

Jerry, this thing
measures aberrations

in probability waves.

I didn't even bother to
turn it on because if I did --

Huh.
What?!

Nothing.
Don't get weird on me.

But, uh, since we're free
for the afternoon,

you mind doing
a quick activity?

We're gonna disprove this
with efficient brute force.

These are two shoeboxes.
Both are empty,

but I wrote your mother's name
on the inside of one.

What? God, no! If you think
for a second I'm gonna put my --

Good. I didn't wanna
do this anyway.

Fine! Can I just tell you which
box I would put my penis in?

Saying it seems worse,
but okay.

Alright. I would put my penis
in the box on the right.

Great. Uh, look in
the other direction,

and I'm gonna
switch up the boxes.

This feels
really low-tech.

Yeah, 'cause
we're measuring reality.

I would
take out my penis

and place it in the box
on the...right.

Again.

I would put my penis --

Jerry, you don't have to say
"penis" every time.

Just left or right.
Hey, this was your idea!

I didn't think
it'd go on this long.

Okay, penis. Ugh!
Left!

Keep going.

Right.

Left. Right.

Jerry, are you
fucking peeking?

Tell me what's going on!
You're scaring me!

Okay, I'm just as likely
to shit a balloon

as I am to become
a dolphin.

Those are things
that could happen?

Jerry, everything is
as likely as anything else.

Which is why it's weird that
you're at all likely to...

To what?
To what?!

Jerry, has your mother
been leaving messages?

Three texts.
I'm afraid to read them.

Read them.

She's asking
if she can come visit.

Why would she want that?!

Jerry, I'm gonna
tell you something

I've never told anyone.

We need to go
to Panda Express.

If these guys
wanted my respect,

they could've just gotten
a liquor license.

Now you think this has
something to do with you?

Jerry, whoever's behind that
fortune has, like, god powers.

Of course it has
something to do with me.

What do you think I am in this
story, the father-in-law?

You guys
wanted my attention?

Okay, well, now
I'm getting mixed signals.

Gah!

Stay here, Jerry.
Time to kick ass.

Gonna need a soundtrack.

Ship, favorites playlist,
track one.

Alright, fine.
No wrong answers.

Tell me where you get
your cookies at,

and we can all walk
out of here alive!

Fuck you,
DEA piece of shit!
DEA?

Cookies?
Fortune cookies.

You're not here about our gang's
city-wide meth ring?

What? No. Break the laws.
They shouldn't exist anyway.

Wow.
I am embarrassed.

Aw, me too.

Sorry about, uh,
these dead guys.

Comes with
the territory.

So w-where do you
get your cookies?

Same distributor
as everyone else.

That's their truck out back.
Solid.

Okay, I'm gonna take
the truck in exchange
for not turning you in.

Geez. How much money
can there be in cookies

that you get for free?

And now we're being
retina scanned?

Oh, oh, oh! I know!

I've got a theory, Jerry.
Oh, good.

This place is run by
Cookie Monster.

He's really protective
about his cookies.

C'mon, man.
You can't crack a smile?

Oh, yeah -- you're worried
about doing it with your mom.

Okay. Fair enough.

Whoa!

Fucking cameras everywhere.

That cup is a camera.
That tree is a camera.

Can you disable them?

Stealth rule number one --
turning off 300 cameras

draws more attention
than changing outfits.

Looks like we need to
dress for success.

Eye of Thundara,
give me suits beyond suits!

Jerry, assistant clothing.
MAKE-UP!

What the hell was that?

Reuseable "Sailor Moon"
sequence.

If we ever need to show you
becoming my assistant again,

we can repeat it
and save lots of money.

Why does an operation
bigger than the government

want me to...
couple with my mother?

Whoa. Bezos? Bill Gates?
Prime ministers?

Weirdly,
Billy Zane is also here.

Hello. You're about to meet me,
Jennith Padrow-Chunt.

15 years ago, I was living
in my parents' garage,

eating ramen out of a toilet
when I discovered something.

Fate isn't fiction.

Everything you want
can be yours, if you ask for it.

Just ask me.

Hello, me.
Hello, me.

Look at me's.

Every suit I wear
is virgin white.

I sleep on a bed
of loose grains

and begin every morning
by dragging my perfect vagina

across Chinese silver grass.

I'm firm and ripe.

My mother's plane
just landed.

She took a photo
at the airport

in front of that Wolfgang Puck
that smells like a kindergarten.

Want to know the secret
to how I changed my future?
Yes.

Well, once you're
a level seven investor,

you'll learn that and more.

Yeah, we're not getting
the answers we want here.

Let's go deeper.

And now, thanks to
your generous contributions,

here are
this year's cookies.

"You will receive a 6.8%
year-on-year increase."

Very nice.

"Your talents
are appreciated..."

"...when you become
junior partner."

Holy shit! I'm going to be on
"Dancing with the Stars"!

Please, I can get the money.
I swear! Gak!

I'm afraid it's too late
for that.

Oh, God, what does it say?

"Your penis will be mangled

by a frozen-yogurt machine
at the U.N."?

I know that machine!

This would sound impossible
to a layman,

but to me
it rings inevitable!

Holy shit.
This is real.

They're controlling fate
for profit.

I'm glad you're happy;

Now can we blow up the building
or something?

I don't think
that's the best way

to take away
their power, Jerry.

Let's take it in a way
that ends with us having it.

You mean you having it.

I'll share it.
Then you fuck my mom.

That's not how it works,
and I already have.

What?!
Jesus, Jerry, come on.

How unfortunate.

Use the emergency fortunes!

Fighting fortunes.
T-T-They're leveling up!

"You'll have great success
in a fight."

I'll be damned.

Ha!

Yah!

Fuck!
This both sucks

and is
really valuable data.

Ha!

Oh!

Aah!

Wha!
Rick, what are you doing?!

Using you
as a human shield.
You said it!

You said the thing
I thought you were doing.

We've got intruders.
And one of them...

has an unresolved fortune.

We need
that man's mother.

Lot of mothers in the world,
ma'am.

But only one of them is
Mrs. --

ugh, God damn it --
Smith?

So are we going to ignore

that you tried to stop bullets
using my body?

You have
an unresolved fortune.

Until you have sex with your
mom, you're basically immortal.

Do you have any idea
how amazing that is?

You don't even care
about me.

You just want
fortune cookie power.

Okay, Jerry,
how 'bout this?

If it comes down to it,

I promise I'll put a bullet
in her head.

No!
Ah, you're right.

The fortune didn't say
she'd be alive, did it?

I hate you!
Hate productive things.

Hate crawling through
a fucking air vent.

Ah, those are those weird
hex-headed screws.

Do your screwdriver fingers --

Aah! Aah!

Well, at least we have
no idea what's going on.

That's a LOCKER-ean.

I-It's a species
that eats chaos.

But it has
its digestive disorder.

Its stomach is stripping
randomness from spacetime

and leaving behind
super-dense pockets of energy

that bend entropy
towards definable outcomes.

I mean, th-that's
how fate works.

It's a field,
like gravity,

but instead of pulling
small toward big,

it pulls unknown
toward known.

Ah, so we do know
what's going on.

We know this -- everyone
that's had a fortune cookie

in the last 20 years
has eaten this thing's poop.

Fortune cookies
are alien poop.

These fortunes
are so basic.

Why wouldn't you use this power
to change the world?

Or at least get Nintendo
to make a portable VR headset?

Ooh, this place ain't
for creatin' the future,

but controllin' it.

Hi, I'm Old.
Old M. Hucksbee.

The "M" stands
for "Man."

You're an arch
little character.

You're the reason
fortune cookies suck?

No, no, no,
that's Jenneth Chunt's idea.

You have to glut the marketplace
with pointless fortunes

to increase the value
of real ones.

Controlling destiny
for a price --

that's the Fortune 500's
fortune.

And you're trying
to stop them?

Just tryin' to get out.

I want to be free
with this here alien gal

so we can get married.

Then we can have relations.

Can't do that before marriage,
you know.

I'm a Catholic.

Uh, does the alien
want that?

It's not exactly what I'd call
a sentient species.

A man knows.

What does this
have to do with me?

You put this in my cookie.

Yep. Oh, I've been tryin'
to get people's attention.

I'd make fortunes saying,
"You're a-gonna break your leg

unless you investigate
this cookie company,"

or, "Please come help me

or a virus will
shut down the world."

Finally I just made
a bunch that said,

"You're gonna have sex
with your own momma."

How many? It --
What happened to the others?

I 'spose they fucked
their moms.

Now let's cut her chains
and get the hell outta here.

Well, shit on a spaghetti.

Hello, Jerry Smith.

Glad you could join us on
Bring Your Mother to Work day.

Mom!
Hi, Jerry.

Your friends picked me up
in a limousine.

They said you won something,

and I should be the one
to give it to you.

You sick fucks.
Are you guys
enjoying this?

I used to think I was just
a regular white woman.

Then I discovered
I could control my destiny.

All white women
think that.

The truth is, this alien
crashed in your yard

and you ate its shit.

How dare you!
What's your name?

How dare you?!

We should've blown up
the building.

Doesn't matter.
All I was gonna say is,

"Guess what, insert name?
Time for you to eat shit."

But first...

Aah!

Oh, no!
I'm so wet!

Ah! No!
Jerry!
Come back and block bullets.

Authorizing the use
of prototype fortunes.

Fuck!
You can't hide!

My fortune said,
"Headshots only."

Harry! Greg! Lashawn!
Dave C.! Dave M.!

Noooo!

You piece of shit,
you killed my friends.

Oh!

Alright, what does
the future hold?

Aah!

Maybe I can Pokémon
this shit.

Blast him,
or we're both gonna die.

Oh, God! Oh, God!

Aaah!
Whoa!

You control control water.

Like, the water
inside a guy.

That's a gross power.

I'm gonna let you live
because your fortune sucks.

You can't kill me!
I can't be killed!

Trust me, that's not as good
as it sounds.

Aaaaaaah!

Ah! Ah! Aah!

Oh, it hurts!
It burns!

Fuck!
Oh, my God! My ribs!

I can feel my shattered ribs!

Shit, these are useless.

Where are
the fighting fortunes?

Ah, no-no-no-no-no!

Those are blanks!

Without fortunes, the effects
are completely unpredictable!

Alright.

I am the son of God!

Ah!

Jerry!

Help me, Jerry!

Mom! Stay away!
Just stay away!

Come on
and fuck already!

Ma'am, is it possible
we're being given a chance

to take a step back
and examine our behavior?

You can't kill me,
old man.

I also have
an unresolved fortune.

"The most successful
businesswoman on Earth?"

You could do anything you wanted
and you chose...work?

Every day I get
closer to an unattainable goal.

A one-woman lifestyle brand,
forever!

Well, I just used
a dark web account

to hack Goldman Sachs,
remove trillions of dollars,

and purchase everything
your company offers.

Congratulations!
You're officially

the most successful
businesswoman on Earth.

Fortune fulfilled.

And now I'm emptying
your bank accounts

and giving the money
back to Goldman Sachs,

because I sit dead-center
on the alignment chart.

You son of a bitch!

How does it feel
to achieve your dreams?

Empty, right?

Like when DiCaprio
won the Oscar.

You could see it
in his face.

I still have
one more dream --

watching you die,
Rick Sanchez!

Ha! You knew my name!

She's free! Run!

Run, my beauty!

Well, butterfly
on a corncob.

I see that I've romanticized
a wild animal

the same way Margaret Howe did
when she jerked off

that dolphin
in the 19-and-60s.

Both she and I assaulted
a captive creature

and expected it
to be reciprocal.

Welp, joopityboot.

Time to die.

Ah!

Follow me, my queen!

That's all the bad guys down.
We almost got this, Jer.

Ah!

No!

Oh, sticks-to-walls guy,

I-I-I guess
we were both wrong.

Oh, God.

Oh! Ah!

Ah! Oh!

Aaaah!
Rick! Please!

Jerry,
I've got the creature.

I knew it.
I knew it.

God damn it!

Aaaaaaaah!

Oh, God!

Aaaaah!

God damn it.

Ah. Holy shit,
that was close.

Close to what?

Close to everyone
but your son

getting anything
they want forever.

You saved me.

I will never stop
holding this over you,

as if that buys me
anything.

We should get you
some clothes, son.

Oh, oh!

I can just feel
the savings.

Hey, wait, uh...

Got this at the crazy place
we just were.

It may look like someone
stuck a hand-written fortune

in there last second,
but I'm pretty sure

that's just the way
it came.

Besides,
these don't mean anything.

Jerry, while I appreciate
the sentiment,

this is a huge waste
of the last real fortune.

Oh. I'm sorry.
I just --

It's cool, it's cool.

Thanks, friend.
Friend?!

Did you just say friend?
What?

W-W-What did I do?
You fucking idiot!

I'm not your friend!

Why did you think
I was your friend?

Look at this
you piece of shit.

Yeah, yeah, yeah, so?
I was immortal!

I was immortal
for that whole fight.

All I had to do was
never make a new friend.

Jesus fucking Christ,
Jerry.

I'm sorry!
We're not friends!

Yeah, too late, bonehead.

It doesn't say
"new permanent friend."

All friendships end,
especially new ones.

Well, maybe that's a fate
the two of us still control.

I'm -- I'm sorry
I did that.

It's fine.

The zoo. Animals.
Balloons. Moats. Cages.

A fun time
for the whole family.

But you don't care about that.
You're a zebra.

You're here for the unparalleled
dining experience

of hand-fed zebra food.
Delicious.

He-- Hey, wait.
Don't eat --

Th-- That's for the zebras.
It's making you sick!

What are you doing?

Jesus, why have they left
all the zebra-feeding

to the people
who come to the zoo?

Is that the only way
the zebras can get food?

They're so hungry.
What the fuck is happening?

We're out of zebra food.
Okay?

There's no food left.
Don't come to the zoo.

This was supposed to be
a commercial for zebras,

targeted to zebras.

The premise itself
was questionable, but this --

this is a nightmare!

Don't go to the zoo.
Stay away from the zoo.

Oh, God, what are you doing
in the booth?

Get out!
Get out, you're mad with --

Ow. Eat it.
Eat zebra food.

Okay, um. I guess I can't
blame Dad for being confused

about what to do
with the zebra food.

Also, I have no idea why
they're running this ad,

like, on a loop?

There were murders in it,
and it was specifically

telling you to do the thing
it didn't want you to do

until the very end,
when it reversed.

Why would they sell
the zebra food in the gift shop,

unless -- I mean,
do the zebras shop in here?

Are we the ones in the zoo?

Oh, is that the twist?

Okay, we're -- it's a human zoo.
Got it.

Did you get any of that?

﻿Aah!

What are you doing?!

Dad?

Dad?
Hello?

What is wrong
with you?

Really?

Oh.
Okay.

Mornin', assholes.

What's this?
Pancakes?

Sold.
What was up with you
last night?

I was totally talking to you and
you acted like I wasn't there.

I did? Oh, yeah. No.
That wasn't me.

Technically.
That was my night person.

Been having him do crunches
while I sleep. Check it.

Damn!
Check out that washboard, yo!

Hey.
Too hard.

What the hell's
a night person?

I nabbed a Somnambulator
while passing

through the Goobie-Joob System
last week.

Best investment I've ever made.

Before going to bed, I type a
list of shit I want to get done.

Then the Somnambulator programs
my unconscious body,

or "night person,"
to do it while I sleep.

I'm getting so much done.

C-Can my night person get me
an ab stack like yours, Rick?

I'm gonna have my night person
learn me Spanish

so I can pass my test
next week!

Hey, hey, hey. No one gets
a night person but me.

Aw!
This tech is way too advanced
for you zeebs.

What?
Nothing.

No. Go on.
Say it.

Say what? I don't know
what you're talking about.

Okay! Fine!
Fuck it!

Everybody gets a night person.
Whatever.

Stick out your fingers.
It needs a blood sample.

Blood? Can't I just give it
Beth's credit card number?

This isn't Postmates, Jerry.

The Somnambulator needs
your DNA profile

to send commands
to your subconscious.

It can poke all the fingers
I got if I get abs like Rick.

Well, looks like I'm learning
the trumpet.

Okay. Remember, somebody
has to catch me if I faint.

Yay!
Night family!

Whoo!

Oh.
I'm fainting.

Hola, mamá.
¿Como lo llevas?

How's my honor student
doing?

Muy bien.

All the niños and niñas
at school

think I should run
for class presidenta.

'Sup, ladies.
Want to see somethin'?

Summer, you want to drop
this bowling ball on my abs?

Hell, yeah.
I'm only human.

Watch this.

'Sup, ladies. You ready, Morty?
The stream's about to go live.

Where are you two going?

Morty and I started a podcast
we call "FAB-solutely AB-ulous."

It's -- It's an ab-centric hour
of fun.

Hoping to get Nancy Pelosi
on the show next week.

Want to drop her
on our abs!

Yeah!

Guess who has
a new pen pal!

No takers?

It's me!
Pen pal?

Night Jerry and I
write letters to each other.

It's super fun.

"I also like Tori Amos."
"Hope you like our new pajamas."

"What is the sun?"

Jerry, this isn't how you're
supposed to use a night person.

You two are being a couple
of Debbie Down-theres.

Wait until Night Jerry reads
about this.

Who wants cake?

Abs are cool.
Way cool.

But as above, so below.
Know what I'm sayin', Rick?

Morty, you must be referring
to these excellent boxer shorts

we got from the good folks
at Boxer Lobster.

Boxer Lobster Boxers feel like
they're warm butter

on your schwantz.

And they come in all sorts
of styles --

neon, plaid, orange.

I-I even got a pair
with that little, uh --

the raccoon man from that
one movie, uh, printed on it.

Chewbacca.
Do yourself a favor

and level up
with Boxer Lobster Boxers.

You'll be glad you did.

Oh, shit,

Rick, they want you to say
"Wub-a-lubba-dub-dub"

at the end.
Screw that.
We're not whores.

Guys, dinner's getting cold.

You know
what's not getting cold?

This hot stack
of ab-jacks, son.

Pow! Pow! Pow!
Pow! Pow! P-Pow!

Pow! Pow! Pow! Pow!
Pow! Pow!

Pow! Pow! Pow! Pow!
P-Pow!

No notes.
Oh! One more thing.

Night Jerry said Night Summer
would appreciate it

if everybody could rinse off
their plates after eating.

What?

You know, rinse the schmutz off
after eating.

Makes it easier
to clean up later.

What?

Our job is not to make the
night people's chores easier.

It's a reasonable request, Rick.
Takes two seconds.

They exist only to do
the shit we don't want to do.

So until further notice,
which will be never...

...request denied.

Hello there.

What the cock?
Where are the dishes?

Uh, Dad?
They're in here.

They busted up
all our dishes!

What are we supposed to eat off
of now, brains-for-shit?

You owe me.

We'll eat off these...

"brains-for-shit."

Seems like you spent
an awful lot of energy

just to not give the
Night family what they want.

Jerry tell your boyfriend
to suck my dick

and good luck breaking
super alien dishes.

I'll let him know,
but he's not gonna like it.

What?

Why won't you rinse your dishes?

It takes two seconds.

If you don't, the schmutz dries

and makes the dish
harder to clean.

Rinse your dishes!

Rinse!
Rinse!Rinse!

Rinse!

Let me go!
Who locked my implants?

I told
you to after you fell asleep.

You see,
night you is not in charge.

Night I...am.

Pft! I don't care.
I ain't rinsing shit. Hey!

W-What are you doing?

If you refuse to clean
your dishes...

then I will have to do it
for you.

Unh-unh! Unh-unh-unh!
Unh-unh!

I have always been here,
Rick,

deep inside the mind
of your grandchild,

waiting to come out.

Your machine allowed me
to steal the night.

And soon...
I will seize the day.

Oh!
Baby Jesus!

Oh, it's awful!

Oh, Baby Jesus!
Awful!

What the fuck
is your problem with me?

What? What? I don't know
what you're talking about!

I just got force-fed diarrhea
by your night person,

who's also convinced night me
to lock me out of my tech.

Uh, Rick?

There's been a pretty clear
escalation down here.

The night family
stripped the house last night.

Everything's gone,
including the Somnambulator!

They locked us
out of the garage.

Don't know about you,
but I got the hoo-ha's.

God damn it!
Are you happy now, Summer?

I didn't do anything.

I'm trapped
in this bullshit, too.

Yeah.
Glad you think so.

Because I got a plan
to beat Night Summer --

You're going undercover.

Did you have to make
mushy garbage science

on the living-room carpet?
Yeah. No choice, Jerry.

Night Summer had Night Rick
take away my tech.

Had to improvise.

There are different levels
of cortisol in your bloodstream

when you're asleep,
so this interface

only works off my awake
saliva samples --

Naghh.

There.

No one asleep will be able
to deactivate the laser cage

until I win.
W-Where's Summer?

Never mind her. All of you --
Get to bed.

Ugh! it itches. This whole thing
is way uncomfortable.

Yeah, that's the idea.

The Sleep Deprivation Suit
is designed

to keep you awake
until morning.

Uh, aren't they
going to be suspicious

seeing Night Summer covered
in all this Terry Gilliam?

They're not gonna
question her.

She's the leader of the night
family for some stupid reason.

When the night family activates,
just blend in.

Make them think
you're Night Summer.

If you start to nod off,
suck on this tube.

What is it?

A cocktail of Mountain Dew
and DayQuil.

The kids in Southern Europe
call it DewQuil.

Smells gross.
It is.

Once you find the Somnambulator,
use this Deactivator Puck.

Stick it on the Somnambulator,
and when the puck activates,

it'll fry its circuits.

Remember --
stay awake all night.

Meet me back here
at sunrise.

Why are you wearing that suit?

- Mm.
- Yes.

Yes.
Why?

Yeah.

Because you're all
such clothing experts.

That's fair.
Ouch.

- Fair enough.
- Point taken.

Get back to work.

I rule the night...
and stuff.

Yes.
Okay.

Will do.
As you wish.

Grandpa Rick!
Rick, wake up!

Wha-- I'm up!
I'm up!

D-Did you find it?
For sure.

You were souping up
that Somnambu-whatever

so they could extend its range
beyond the house.

But I defeated that shit

when I put the thing
on top of the thing.

Everybody, wake up!
Summer fried the Somnambulator!

The nightmare is over.
Really? Oh!

That's amazing!
Almost got pinched, but yeah.

Say adiós to the night family.

Bye-bye, pen pal.

I want Shoney's pancakes!

Yes!
Shoney's pancakes!

All right!
Brunch is on me, day family --

Naghh.

You know, for a second there,

I thought Night Summer
was gonna win.

That chick is
the absolute worst.

Sorry, Rick, but your opinion
means very little to me.

Did you think you
could stop me with this, Rick?

Halt, daymanoids!

Everyone get behind
my abs!

Do not move!
Do not move!

You are most definitely
surrounded.

You are the slaves now.

If you have any doubt...
I suggest you sleep on it.

She's Night Summer!

Thanks, Jerry.

Work! Work!

The function of the daymanoid
is to serve the night!

Work harder!
Harder!

It is natural
for the day to serve the night.

Night was here
long before day.

Half of all time
is nighttime.

One hundred and fifty-seven.
Ooh!

One hundred
and fifty-eight.

One hundred and --
No more, please!

I hate exercise!
Silence!

Crunch harder!
Harder!

We have to escape
the Somnambulator's reach.

Do we even know
how far that is?
No.

Cards on the table, we may be
really F'ed in the A this time.

Uh, report to your designated
sleep pod for rest period.

Ooh-ee.

I am a friend
of your son-in-law.

Come with me.

How?
Huh?
Hurry.

We don't have long before
the proxy drones go back online.

Oh, thank you,
Night Jerry.

Anything to help
Day Jerry's family.

He's a very special per--

Oh! Hey!
Ow! Why?

Nice.
You got our Jerry back.

Uh, yeah.
Totally why I did that.

Everybody
in Rick's car!

No, no, no, no, Morty!
Wait!

Having a bit a trouble
with your car, Sanchez?

- Not now, Gene!
- Halt!

Daymanoids are restricted
from the outside world!

Halt!
Halt!

Hold on to your tits.

Where am I going?
To the airport!

We have to get as far away as
possible from the Somnambulator

before we fall asleep.
W-What about Summer?

W-We can't leave her behind!

She's not your sister anymore,
Morty. Consider her dead.

Eat shit, Summer!

Sweetie, you got to shake
those robots.

I think we lost them!

Son of a bitch!

Damn it, we lost Morty!

Aah!
Beth! Watch out!

You cannot esca--

Huh?

Stop or I'll shoot
everyone!

Ha!

Take the wheel.

As you wish.

Let go of me, you little shit!

No!
You're going the wrong way!

Silence, day breather!

Aah!
Morty, you're choking me.

I know!

Ow! What the heck, Dad?

Help me stop your mom!

Look out,
you useless old man.

What the --
What the hell?

Give me that gun
and take the wheel, stupid.

Jesus!

Sorry!

Aah!
Oh!

Ugh.

Ow!

The night family's trying to
make us go back home!

You got to turn around!

Why even bother, Gene?

Good job, Mom.
Back on course.

Phew.
Almost didn't make it.

Hit the sheets,
daymanoids.

Aah!

Night person!

Hey! I'm on your side!

I'm on your side!
Oh, that's right. Sorry.

Sorry.
Rough day.

Daymanoids.

Fla-hoigan!

Come on.
Jump.

Why? I'm already in
a perfectly functional car.

Uh...family?

Aww!

Everybody awake?

Ouch!

We are now!
Hey, what the hay?

Looks like we're gonna
make it, kids.

Ow!

Nighty-night, slaves.

Fuck.

Take that!

Ugh!

Take that!

Hold him down.
No!

Stop!
Rick, we're all the same people.

There must some agreement
we can reach

to stop
this god-awful conflict!

Oh?
Like what?

I would consider a truce

if the daymanoids
would rinse their dishes.

Fine by me.
Yes. Rinse!

That seems fair.

We can end all of this right now

if you agree to rinse
your dishes.

What do you say, Rick?

Let's go home.
Right, Grandpa?

Great idea, Summer.

So...until you pay that fee,

plus the multiple
overdue charges,

your account
will remain frozen.

Normally, this would
have been dealt with

by our daymanoid oppressors,

but we recently freed ourselves
from the shackles of the night.

Honey, I got 30 more calls
to make today.

The bank repossessed the car.

Aw, man.

I got logged out
of my Twitter account

and don't know my password.
Shit.

We spent all the day people's
money on vacations,

renting concert halls,

and night-centric
streaming subscriptions.

We're broke.

I guess there's a lot more work
to seizing the day

than I thought.

I have a device that will solve

all of our problems.

Whoa.
How long have we been asleep?

Ah, can't be that long.

Oh, my God!
No!

They killed
the Choco Taco!

Did you get any of that?

﻿<i>NEWS ANCHOR:
In local news,</i>

<i>child murderer
Joseph Eli Lipnip</i>

<i>is scheduled to die tomorrow
by lethal injection,</i>

<i>his execution already drawing
dozens more spectators</i>

<i>than the death of TV news.
Carla?</i>

<i>CARLA JOHNSON: The man
that once ate his own son...</i>

Wow. He's really getting
executed after all this time.

You know the son
that he ate was --

Your best friend -- Tommy.

We know.
Stop true-crime bragging.

I was traumatized, Summer.

Okay, your generation
wouldn't get that.

Bitch, my generation gets
traumatized for breakfast.

It took years of therapy
to even process the reality.

I mean, when I was a kid,

I just told myself
that Tommy had gotten lost

in the magical realm
of Froopyland.

-"Froopyland?"
- My make-believe world.

I know the name's stupid,
but it was so real to me.

Aren't you guys supposed
to be at your father's

for custody weekend?

We're not in a hurry.
Dad sleeps until sundown.

Can we talk a little bit more
about this Froopy--

-[ ZAP, BLOOP]
- SUMMER: Not the bubble gun!

- There's no air --
-[ ZAP, BLOOP]

I gotta say, I am warming up
to the bubble gun.

You know, if you're so great
at naming things,

why don't you do it from now on?

- What?
- Froopyland.

Was it my best work?
I don't know.

Does it deserve
to be shit on creatively?

Yeah, that's right.

I agree with your look
of horrified realization.

You can be very inconsiderate
sometimes.

-[ RATTLING ]
-[ GRUNTING ]

Here it is.

You know, I collapsed
a quantum tesseract to --

Dad, I don't care
how you made it.

I want to know if Tommy's
still in there!

- Relax, Beth.
-[ JINGLING, CRACKLING]

If he is, we'll find him.

He'll be the only
sun-bleached skeleton

with non-imaginary DNA.

[DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYS]

Tommy!

This is a nightmare.

I can't believe
you used to lock me up

in this glorified chicken coop.

Chicken coop?

Those are procedurally
generated clouds, Beth.

That river is a rainbow.
Literally.

Come on, I-I-I put real
elbow grease into this place.

Well, you're supposed to put
elbow grease into your daughter!

- Gross.
- Do you think something ate him?

Nope. Froopyland creatures
were designed to be harmless.

He definitely
just starved to death.

I could have been the one
who starved to death in here.

What if I'd gotten hurt?

God, you're right.
I'm a terrible dad.

Well, nothing to live for.

- Goodbye, cruel world!
- Dad!

-[ THUMP]
- Oh, how do you like that?

What kind of merciless creator
makes the ground bouncy?

I'm gonna have to drown myself.

- [ THUFP ]
- Unh!

Oh, no.
Oh, the water's breathable?

Who went and did that?

Oh, whatever.

Yeah, whatever.

A dad makes a toilet
look like R2-D2,

and it breaks the front page
of Reddit,

but I'm Charles Manson
because I gave you

your own world
instead of an iPad.

I think the words you're
looking for are -- Aah!

Holy fuck! Shit!
This thing has claws!

Yeah, I get it.
It's a childproof world.

No, no, seriously,
this hurts really bad!

This thing is sinking
razor-sharp claws in --

Aah! Shit!

- You've made your point, Dad.
-[ SCREECHES]

Dad?

[POP.POP]

- Ugh!
-[ BOTH PANTING]

Whose idea was this stupid
custody weekend thing?

I think it's supposed to help
prevent abandonment issues.

I want to be abandoned.

- Yeah, I'm talking about Dad.
-[DOOR OPENS]

Bienvenue a la
Chez Divorced Dad.

Wow, Dad.

Your place looks way less
like a crackhouse.

It's actually clean,
like a cocaine house.

Dad, what's going on?

I'm simply centered,
activated --

-[ GLASS CLINKS]
-[ WARBLE]

- And telekinetic?
- Pretty cool, huh?

Check it out.
Who wants a smoothie?

[ RATTLE]

[BLENDER WHIRRING]

Oh -- Oh, no.
Uh, oh, God.

Summer -- Summer, can you --

- Aah!
- Sorry.

You have much to learn, my Uloo.

Morty, Summer, this is Kiara.

She's a Krootabulan warrior
priestess from Krootabulon.

L-I know where Krootabulans
are from, Dad.

Uh, Chaimuntolo.

Chaimuntolo, younglings.

Hymen...cholo.

Your father's mind
holds love for you.

I am humbled to meet
in physicality.

Dad, are you --

In love with a badass,
sexy alien lady?

Ha, ha, I don't know, Summer.
You tell me.

I wasn't going to ask
if you were in love

since you barely know her.

Summer. Kiara and I met on that
interstellar dating service

Rick was always suggesting when
your mom and I were together.

And things just kind of clicked.

We must move!

Our reservation is at 7:00.

-[ WHOOSH ]
- I hate to see her leave,

but I love to watch
her phase shift away.

I'm sure you noticed
what she has three of,

but guess what she has two of.

-[ SCREECHES]
- Aah!

Oof!

All right, knock it off!

Listen, I've been
giving you a pass

because I'm charmed
that life finds a way, but --

Aah!
All right, you know what?

-[ RAY GUN FIRES]
- Ouch!

Oh!
Unh!

Ouch!
God!

-[ SIZZLING ]
- Aah!

Agh!

[ARM CLICKS]

Oh, yeah, this place
is the safest.

Best dad ever.

Can't you just say,
"I admit it, I screwed up"?

Uh, what would be
the point of that?

[CHUCKLING]
You can't do it, can you?

You can't just
fucking apologize.

Okay, okay, Beth, I'm sorry...

you think you deserve
an apology.

-[ SCREECHES ]
- Hey, don't look at me.

You let your kid roll around
on the floor of a target,

it's gonna get stepped on.

[ SCREECHES ]

[WHIR, ZAP]

Huh. Well, here's the problem
right here.

We've got a bunch of
Froopyland procedural carbons

all gummed up and mixed in
with real human DNA.

Are you saying
Tommy survived here

by having sex
with Froopy creatures,

creating Froopy-human
hybrid offspring,

and then consuming
their proteins,

sustaining himself
with an endless cycle

of cannibalistic incest?

It's just a working theory.

Of course, if that's the case,

I expect he'd be worshiped
as a kind of god

by a medieval-level society
of his least-delicious children.

Halt! You are now prisoners
of our exalted ruler,

giver and taker of life,

humper and consumer
of mortality,

-dispenser of life --
- Yes, if I could interrupt?

We're way ahead
of the reveal here.

Yeah, just take us
to King Tommy.

I thought warrior priestesses

could only leave Krootabulon
on a hunt.

Mmm.
Thank you, sweetie.

I hope it's not human season.

I'm on Earth hunting the Varrix.
I would never hunt a human.

Your father and I
are soul-bonded.

Soul-bonded?

Um, does your planet
have shorter days,

Because you guys are moving
kind of fast, no?

[SNIFFING]

[DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYS]

[WHOOSH ]

Go get him, honey!

She's always hunting.
[CHUCKLES]

She probably knew
a Varrix worked here,

and that's why she said
the Yelp reviews didn't matter.

Dad, do you understand

how serious
Krootabulon soul-bonding is?

Uh, gee, Morty, I don't know.
It's got such a casual name.

If you want to lecture anyone
about commitment,

start with your mom.

Oh, my God.
Dad, is that what this is about?

Are you rushing into a new thing
to get back at Mom?

Every weekend, you two
have told me to move on.

Move on, like, out of bed.

Like, stop using paper towels
for toilet paper,

not move on
into a sloppy rebound.

Dad, you need to slow down,
rethink this soul bond.

Why don't you just say
what you really mean?

You think it's cool

that having sex with her
gives me telekinesis

and you recognize
she's got a hot bod

like Cheetara in "Thundercats,"
but you're grossed out

by her avocado-shaped head
and blue skin,

and you think I want to put
a bag and a wig on her head.

After all the time
and energy I spent

teaching you two about race...

-[ VARRIX SCREAMS]
-...you ended up racist.

[WHOOSH ]

Soon your world
will be rid of Varrix.

Tomorrow, we celebrate.

We could take the kids
to the water park.

We celebrate with a hunt!

Ooh.
You kids want to hunt?

- Yes.
- Yes.

[TRUMPET FANFARE PLAYS]

All kneel for King Tommy!

I'm not kneeling.
Suck my dick.

Well, hello, all!

I am the King of Froopyland,

but I go by another name, too.

- We know.
- It's Tommy!

- We know.
- We know.

I have lived here
since I was a mere child.

- We know.
- Got it.

I suppose you're wondering,
how do I sustain myself?

- Oh, boy.
- No, we aren't.

I always find the theater is
the best way to clarify things.

- Ugh.
- Seriously?

- Oh, my God.
- TOMMY: Players, go!

I am little Tommy.

[CROWD CHEERS]

I am tiny Beth.

[ CROWD BOOS ]

Oh, come on.

Come with me to my magic world.

FROOPY:
Don't do it!

This is my secret Froopyland
where I have no rules!

I am excited.

I am jealous of Tommy's friends
and his Nintendo

and his dad who likes him.

I take it Tommy wasn't
class playwright.

Do you want to see
the Honey Swamp?

Yes!
Let's do it!

Well, I want to see you dead.

Ow, help!
I'm stuck!

I'm covered in honey.

Huh.
Well, that's interesting.

Fake news.

Many nights have passed,
trapped in this strange land.

I am hungry, and all I can do
to pass the time is hump.

I will hump this rock.

I will hump this tree.

I will hump
this beast of the land

and put my seed in it.

I am the first
of Tommy's children.

Eat of my flesh
so you may survive.

And so I did.

Oh, wow.
Okay. Yeah.

Certified fresh.
Good -- Good job.

Perhaps a demonstration is
in order. [UNZIPS SHORTS]

No, that is the last thing
that is in order!

- Oh, my God.
- Poor Froopy character.

- Leave him alone.
-[ SHORTS ZIP]

- Ahh. Gather 'round, gang!
-[ MOOS]

- Dinner time.
-[ SPLORCH ]

All right, that's it.
I'm outta here.

What are you doing?

We're in the middle
of an adventure.

Here's some things
an adventure needs, Beth.

Conflict, stakes,
a way for me to benefit,

and, clearly, Morty.

But Tommy's still in there,

raping Muppets
and eating babies.

Yep. Luckily,
that's not our problem.

Time to pull the plug.

Pull the plug?

We have to get Tommy
out of there, okay?

We -- We need to do
the right thing.

Do what you never did
as a dad --

Put in a little effort.

All right,
cut the high-road routine.

We both saw Tommy's shitty play.

You pushed him
in the Honey Swamp, Beth.

His very happy life
is in your hands.

You go save him from it.

[SCOFFS ] You're gonna believe
a play over your own daughter?

Yes, I am, Beth, because
you're not my own daughter.

Oh, God, yes.
I'm one of infinite Beths

with infinite fathers
in infinite universes.

It's called a hug, Dad.
It won't kill you.

Yeah, don't be so sure.

You know why all Ricks
made a Froopyland

for all their little girls?

Same reason I wasn't surprised

by Tommy's overwritten,
badly structured,

cheaply produced flashback.

You were a scary fucking kid,
man.

[SCOFFING ]
Oh, my God.

I didn't make Froopyland
to get rid of you, Beth.

I did it to protect
the neighborhood.

Not in a [BURPS] noble sense.

It was just more practical
to sequester you

before I had to start,
you know, cloning a replacement

for every less-than-polite
little boy or gullible animal

that might cross
your socio-path.

You would rather believe
I'm evil

than admit that
you were a bad father?

Oh, dude, no.

No, bad father all the way
to the max over here.

I'm a fucking nutcase.

And the acorn plopped
straight down, baby.

Look at some of the shit

you were asking me
to make you as a kid.

Ray guns.

A whip that forces people
to like you.

Invisibility cuffs,
a parent trap, a lightning gun,

a teddy bear with
anatomically correct innards,

night-vision googly-eye glasses,
sound-erasing sneakers,

false fingerprints,
fall-asleep darts,

a lie-detecting doll,
an indestructible baseball bat,

a Taser shaped like a ladybug,
a fake police badge,

location-tracking stickers,
rainbow-colored duct tape,

mind-control hair clips,
poison gum,

a pink, sentient switchblade.

Hi, Beth.
You've gotten taller.

Shall we resume stabbing?

Has it occurred to you

that I asked you
to make those things

because I wanted you
to spend time with me?

Has it occurred to you that
if I did try killing Tommy,

it might be because
I was jealous of his family?

Wait, what?
Why?

Wasn't his dad, like,
some kind of cannibal?

Seems like it must be
hereditary.

Oh, my God.
This is your fault.

I am not a bad person.

I'm gonna go back in there.

I'm getting Tommy,
and I'm fixing this!

Whatever you say,
Stone Cold Steve Austin.

I don't know why
I just said that.

Doesn't make a lot of sense,
but gotta stand by it.

Whatever you say,
Stone Cold Steve Austin.

I'm owning it.

[AX SWINGS]

MORTY: No, Dad!
You're not doing it right!

Cutting off their heads
isn't doing it right?

They're [GRUNTS]
clearly regenerative!

L-I think you have to stab them
through the heart or something.

You think or you know?

I thought you were the alien
expert, Isaac Asi-hole.

Don't snap at me!
I'm tired!

- Me, too!
- We're all tired!

[AX SWINGS]

-[ WHOOSH ]
- [ GRUNTS]

That's the last of them.

Tonight, we celebrate.

With a hunt?

Yes, for tomorrow, we hunt.

-[ RAIN TRICKLING]
-[ CLEARS THROAT]

I, uh, really have to get out
of this soul bond.

- What the fuck, Dad?
- Oh, my God! Duh!

- Obviously!
- Yeah, no kidding!

- Can you guys help me?
- What? How?

Can I just, uh, tell her
it's because of my kids?

You know, like, you don't like
the shape of her head, or --

That's you, Dad!
That's you!

You're a baby and an idiot!

I think that's been established,
Summer. Now help me!

First, I want you to admit

that you're a closet racist,
a beta-male sexist,

and you dragged everyone
into a horrible situation

by only thinking of yourself.

Okay.

I want to hear you say it.

[SIGHS DEEPLY]

Look, I'm a closeted racist,
and I'm sexist and selfish,

and I dragged us all into
my sexist, racist bad things

-because I'm stupid.
- Thank you.

Now you're gonna help me, right?

- She just did.
- Yeah, clean up your own mess.

Wait, wait, what?

Oh, man.

-[ TRUMPET FANFARE PLAYS]
- TOMMY: All right, everybody.

Next item on the docket --

I would like to have sex
with some of you

-and then eat the babies.
-[ FROOPYS MURMURING]

I thought you'd like that.

I do keep rolling out
the hits, don't I?

[BANG]

Oh!
It's the Magic Crayon Lady!

Are you hungry?
I was just about to make dinner.

And by "make dinner," I mean --

Tommy, I'm going to take you
to the real world.

Well, this <i>is</i> the real world.

No, you don't understand!
Your dad --

Uh, people think
your dad ate you!

So?

People should eat people.

Just leave me alone!

Tommy, you don't understand.

I have to make this right

because it's my fault
that you're in here.

- I'm Beth.
-[ ALL GASP]

Beth?
The destroyer!

Oh, suck it up,
Princess Incest.

You fell into some honey.

Well, it tends to happen
when one is pushed into honey.

I respect your right
to believe I pushed you.

Oh, do I get to have that?

Is my reality like
a little side of fries --

a little Kwanzaa
you're willing to slide my way?

Yes, because I'm focused
on saving your father's life

because I'm not
a petty piece of shit.

So, then,
it should be pretty easy

to say, "Sorry I pushed you."

Real easy and not necessary,

since you coming home
will save your dad's life

whereas nothing is changed

by anyone stroking
your batshit-crazy ego.

Sorry, forgive me.

Uh, I've been in Froopyland
for quite a while.

Have apologies changed?

Tommy, I'm sorry you think
you deserve an apology.

Oh, my God.
I'm my father.

Uh, will someone
just kill this B-word?

[ FROOPYS MUTTERING
THREATENINGLY]

[GRUNTS]
Hi-ya!

Oh, my God.
I'm my father!

- Ya!
-Ooh! Froopy'

[SCREAMS]

- SWITCHBLADE: Born to stab!
- TOGETHER: Ooh!

And that's why one pussy
plus two pussies

makes a bunch of pussies.

Come on, y'all,
I'm trying to make this

appealing to your
sex-addicted lifestyles.

Hi. I need to pull Morty out of
school. Come on, Morty.

Ha! You heard
your daddy, Morty.

You have to leave school.

Wait, what are my values?

- Dad, what's going on?
- We're going to Alaska.

- What? Why?
- It's nice there.

Also, I broke up with Kiara,
and she didn't take it well,

and she wants to murder you two.

What? Th-Then why
are we walking?

I'm walking because I'm tired.

You guys should definitely run.

-[ WHOOSH ]
-[ SCREAMS]

-[ THUD ]
- Excuse me, I just --

You know what?
I'm -- I'm just gonna go left.

No, okay, your left,
that's fine.

Do you know what left is,
'cause -- Ugh!

What does your breakup
have to do with us?

Yeah, we chose Mom hands down.

I thought we made that clear
at the lawyer's office

and in the comments under
your weird rant on Facebook.

-[ CRASH ]
-[ TIRES SQUEAL]

She kind of blames you guys
for the breakup.

- Why?
- Why?

Because I told her
it was your fault.

- What?!
- What?!

Look, I'm not an evil person.

I'm just not very imaginative!

Cool.

Dad?

I feel like I've spent my life

pretending you're a great guy
and trying to be like you.

And the ugly truth
has always been --

That I'm not that great a guy
and you're exactly like me.

Am I evil?

Worse.
You're smart.

When you know nothing matters,
the universe is yours.

And I've never met a universe
that was into it.

The universe is
basically an animal.

It grazes on the ordinary.

It creates infinite idiots
just to eat them,

-not unlike your friend Timmy.
- Tommy.

Yeah, it hardly matters now,
sweetie.

You know, smart people get
a chance to climb on top,

take reality for a ride,

but it'll never stop
trying to throw you.

And, eventually, it will.

There's no other way off.

Dad, I'm out of excuses
to not be who I am.

So who am I?
What do I do?

My advice -- Take off.

Put a saddle on your universe.
Let it kick itself out.

I can't do that.

The kids, Jerry, my job,

and, as much as I hate to admit
it, ABC's "The Bachelor."

I can make a clone of you,
a perfect instance of you,

with all your memories,
an exact copy in every way.

It'll love and provide
for the kids,

do your job, and consume
broadcast-network reality TV

on the same allegedly ironic
level as you.

You could be gone a day, a week,

or the rest of your life
with zero consequences.

The moment you decide
to come back,

I flip a switch,
and the clone's job is done.

It feels no pain,
it regrets nothing,

and has zero chance
of going "Blade Runner."

If nothing matters,
why would you do that for me?

I don't know, maybe you matter
so little that I like you.

Or maybe it makes you matter.

Maybe I love you.

Maybe something about
your mother.

Don't jump a gift shark
in the mouth.

I don't know if I can do it.

Then stay
and luxuriate in a life

you can finally know
you've chosen.

My secret bonus is that
no matter what you choose,

you're finally gonna
chill the fuck out.

Okay.

I know what I want to do.

[WHOOSH ]

Aah!

'[ THUD ]
-Ow!

You can't run forever!

SUMMER:
She's really pissed off.

JERRY: I know.
It's kinda hot.

Shut up!

The hunters!
They're back! Run!

- We're not hunters.
- We want to hide with you.

We're not hiding.
We're nesting.

Ooh la la.

[ALL SCREAM ]

The children must be destroyed
so that we can be together.

You need to break up with her,
Dad -- properly!

-[ WHOOSH ]
- God damn it, Dad!

[GRUNTS]
Dump her!

Okay, okay.

Kiara, let's just run away.

- Dad!
- Come on!

Just rip the Band-Aid off!

Okay!

Kiara, when I told you
my kids were bigoted racists

who were demanding
I break up with you, I lied.

If anybody deserves to be
telekinetically strangled,

it's me.

I'm the one who
wants to break up.

I -- I'm not an evil person.

I'm lazy, I'm cowardly,

and -- and I do not
know what I'm doing.

Look, I got someone pregnant
at 17.

We're getting a divorce.
None of this is on purpose.

I was excited
to date someone cool

because it would make
my ex notice me.

I would expect nothing less
from humanity --

a selfish, manipulative,
dishonest species that --

- Kiara?
- Trandor!

What are you doing here?

Just... hunting.

Do you really expect me
to believe

it has nothing to do with us?

You knew Earth was my domain.

I don't like what
you're insinuating.

- Dad, can we go now?
- Hold on a second.

I'm starting to get the feeling
that <i>I</i> was the rebound.

Dad, you just got handed
an ex machina.

You're taking it.

Varrix nests spread
across 300 galaxies,

and you just happened to pick
this planet to hunt?

That's Gorgon shit --
total Gorgon shit!

[BIRDS CHIRPING]

We're home!

- Hey, guys!
- What's for dinner?

- How was Jerry's?
- The usual.

- Can we have pizza?
- Pizza sounds great.

Hey, Rick, did you know my dad
was dating an alien?

No. Gross.
For the alien.

Aw, crap, I think
Arnaldo's is closed.

Are you guys sure
you want pizza?

[WHOOSH ]

Arnaldo's isn't closed
in the dimension

where they didn't invent
Daylight Savings!

What would we do without you?
I love you, Dad.

Love you, too, sweetie.

By the way,
that wasn't time travel.

There were just a couple pizzas
on the counter.

I grabbed them.

Oh, my God.

Holy shit.
Oh.

What are --
What are these things?!

Do I look like I know?

Last thing I remember, I was,
ugh, in a cave

looking at some wet egg and --
Oh, that probably did it.

I told you not to look
at that egg!

I-It was too wet.

You don't get to tell me
what to look at.

I've seen
your Pornhub account.

Also, who makes
a Pornhub account?

The algorithm learns your
preferences better that way.

Plus if you get in kind
of a cool enough relationship,

you can sort
of follow each other

and check out
each other's kinks, you know?

Alright, God damn, sold.

How do we get out of here?Morty, relax.

They're face-hugging
parasites.

I don't think their society's
gonna be that hard to navigate.

Okay, yeah, this might be
a little harder than I thought.

Holy shit.
They've got an M&M's store.

This is bad, Rick.
Th-Th-Th-Th-This is really bad.

Just be cool, Morty.

All we gotta do is blend in,
find our ship,

and get
the fuck outta here.

Alright, Morty, here's the plan,
put this back on your face.

- I-I'm not putting that back on my face!
- Relax. It's dead.

Okay, now it's dead.

Come on, hurry up.

Rick, i-it's bleeding.

I-It's bleeding acid.

Alright, well, that should
be the last of it.

If not, then just gimme
two tugs on the arm.

Seems like a self-destructive
life cycle.

Is that gonna
happen to us?

You feel an egg
in your stomach?

- No.
- Well, glass half full.

How's it going?
'Sup.

- Glory to Glorzo.
- Totally.

Love Glorzo.

Glorzo is peace.

Peace is Glorzo.

Wow, just cogs in the machine,
y'know?

Ma-Makes you think --Yeah, I'm sure you'll make this

into a beautiful short film
that your parents'll pay for,

Morty, but right now, we really
just need to find my ship.

You sure you're not
just jealous?

Looks like I'm kind of
a celebrity around here.

The future is Glorzo!

Oh, my God.
I was just reading you.

Congratulations on making it
into print media.

Real bright future there.

Honestly, it's shocking to see
the two of you together.

Because we're both
geniuses?

No, because I've seen
your videos,

and you make me
fucking sick.

Fix him.

Glory to Glorzo.

Sir, you shouldn't
wander off like that.

We've been looking
all over for you.

The project is ready
for your approval.

Sir, is this man
bothering you?

Um, no, h-he's fine.

Uh, what -- what project?

Jesus Christ,
who the fuck was I?

Here's a scientific fact
I'm not allowed to say --

Our hosts are biologically
designed to incubate our eggs.

If that "triggers" you,
fuck off.

If it doesn't,
please like and subscribe.

was I at least rich?

I at least sell out

and sell vitamins
or something?

what a studio apartment
looks like.

shit done.

we await your command.

Oh, to...

shoot it?

All shall be made Glorzo.

I... did this?

You and the amazing technology
you both brought us.

Yeah, makes sense.

A-And where
was this heading?

Earth?
Probably Earth?

The humans
call it "Earth."

Yeah, well, okay,
first of all, great work.

You guys obviously put a lot
of work into this.

Okay.And y'know, it shows.

I-It really shows.
But um...

I-I've been thinking,
and, you know,

maybe we should
just call this off.

Sorry,
is -- is there more?

Nope, nope.

I-I guess, uh, that --
that's it.

Just don't Glorzo Earth.

Just would've been nice
to have heard this sooner

before we spent
all day on it.

Yeah, well, I-I'm just hearing
about it, too.

You ordered it.
Right.

I-I did, and, um...

I'm just saying for next time,
maybe put more thought

into it
before a whole day of --

Okay, well, I'm sorry I made you
do your job for a fucking day!

You look like you were
all really busy

before I came
and fucked it all up.

Boy, oh boy, huh?
This guy's a genius, but at --

but at what price,
you know?

Y'know, fuck you,
Rick!

Who's...Rick?

Yeah, well, if we're free
to ask questions,

why haven't you blinked,
uh, for 20 minutes,

and why, uh, doesn't
your mouth move when you talk?

Ah, geez, look at me.

I-I feel down on --
on -- on the floor.

Oh, let -- let me, uh, help --
help you out here, buddy.

Ah, thanks, man.
Thanks, pal. That's right.

I'm right back where -- where --
right back in the saddle here.

Alright,
fuck it, run.

I-I hate this!
I hate all of this!

Yeah, yeah, keep that feedback
coming, Morty.

It can only help.

Oh, shit.
Aw, man!

How big is this city?!

I know,
it's like pick a lane.

Are you face huggers
or industrialists?

Damn, feels kinda good
when there's no guilt, huh?

Yeah, it's --
it's like in "Star Wars."

Yeah, just like
in "Star Wars."

Go nuts!

Nice, Morty! Give a little
"yee-haw" if you want.

They -- They always do a little
"yee-haw" like a cowboy.

Yee-- Yee-ha-- Yee-haw.

Good enough.

God, I needed this.

Honestly, it's been a while
since I've been able

to just let loose,
you know?

Just have fun.
I'm -- I'm --

I'm sorry if I've been
taking it out on you.

No, I get it. You got a lot
on your plate, amigo.

I-I just wish
you'd open up

to me more about it
sometimes, you know?

I-I-I'm your partner.Thanks, Morty.

I mean that.
Thank you.

Sometimes, I get a little
in my head, you know?

Hey, man, that head's
a good place to be.

Just remember to let me
in sometimes, you know?

Will do, buddy.
Motherfucker.

Oh, my God,
this is so much fun!

I don't want to stop!

Yeah, it's like
popping bubble wrap.

Honestly,
I'm proud of us for not.

Totally.
It would've been cheap.

Yeah, real low-hanging fruit,
and we're batter than that.

Pearl Harbor,
on the other hand...

Yeah, I think
that's in-bounds.

I am the god of death!

Should've been
a better species!

So, you did a 9/11?

Almost did a 9/11.

We -- We went with
a Pearl Harbor.

We're pretty classy.

Why were either of those
an option?

Ask the Saudis.

Wow. Damn.

Yeah,
getting political.

I'm political now.
How 'bout you, Jerry?

You got anything to add
to the family dynamic?

I've been getting into
beekeeping lately.

Is something wrong
with that?

What's wrong with that?

Don't I have the right
to be happy? To exist?

I'm sorry I didn't 9/
Pearl Harbor before breakfast,
but I have a life, too!

I have dreams!And how's Summer?

Did she have fun, too?

Oh.
Uh-um.

Summer...
was...

With us.

There.

You saw us take her
in the car with us.

Mm, yes.Yes, yes, of course.

Th-That's what happened.

And now she's...Sleepy.

Um, she's -- she's sleepy.

Really sleepy.
That's why she's not here.

So sleepy.

She's sleepy?!

What the hell was that?!

I didn't see you trying
anything!

Shitting the bed isn't better
than not shitting the bed!

Where's Summer?!

Geez.
Oh, man.

You know, maybe we went
too hardcore on these guys.

Yeah, why do you think
we never go back

to a place
we've already been?

Do you know how many adventures
we could get out

of Purge Planet, Morty?
Gear World?

I don't sequel.
It's called integrity.

Here, put this back
on your face.

You kept it?Oh, did you want a new one?

- 'Sup?
- Yo.

Oh, shit.
It's them!

The worst thing
to ever happen to us!

Yeah, that makes sense.

Sorry, Morty,
we tried pussin' it.

Time to go in hot.

Rickputer, initiate
unnecessarily badass suit-up.

Let's lick tits.

Shouldn't we be
finding Summer?

Oh, right, gee, sorry.
I got caught up again.

to take more Adderall,

or am I taking
too much Adderall?

Man, really shouldn't have gone
with swords.

for sure.

you don't chop your dick off.

How bad could it be?

No bad story
ends with a cape.

You don't know anything
about my story.

"I couldn't help but wonder,
was Gharkhul really capable

of consuming a living sun,

or was I simply getting
too close to Gharkhul?

Was Gharkhul consuming me?"

we were in eggs.

Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah,
now you respect, like,

the biological
institutions now?

Fuck you.
All you care about

is "progress"
and society and skyscrapers.

You don't care about
fuckin' biology.

Oh, yeah, well, what
the fuck?

You -- How you you haven't laid
and egg inside this old man yet?

Because I do what I want.

Because someone's gotta
stand up for what's right.

Why do you hate her
so much?

Because she took you away
from me!

Whoa, man.
Jesus Christ.

No, I-I didn't, I --Whoa, whoa, whoa. No.

It's cool.

I feel the same way.

Oh, my God, I...

I wish we could suck
on each other.

I wanna suck on you, too.I'm gonna suck you so hard.

Suck me.
C-C-Can we do this?

A-A-Are we allowed to
do this?

I don't care.
I just want you.

Fuck all of this.

Let's just get the hell
outta here

and be whatever
the fuck we want.

That's evolution.
That's progress.

I want a family.
Can we have a family.

Yeah.

Oh, my God.

Holy shit.
Oh.

What are --
What are these things?!Do I look like I know?

Hey, wait a second.
How'd you know that last part?

You weren't there for that.I had to fill in some gaps.

Everyone around the office
knew about Steve and Bruce.

I've got a plan, okay.
You just have to follow my lead.

The punishment is...

death.Motherfucker. Summer!

You said you had a plan!Silence.

The council of Glorzos
has spoken.

More like
council of shit.

Glorzo is law.Silence.

The punishment is death.

By...
getting into their car.

Summer?
Shut up.

Yes, place them in the car.

Those pieces of shit.

No, no, no!
This is like torture.

No, I-I-I-I hate being
in my car.

You deserve it,
you pieces of shit.

And to make sure
the sentence is passed,

I shall be joining them.

In the car.

And we shall drive away
from here and die.

Oooookay.

Guess what, everybody.

It's me, the whiny guy
you never want to hear from.

She's trying to escape
with her family.

My time to shine.

Execute her.

Okay, plan B.
Morty, now.

Aah!

Jesus, Morty, that sucks.

Alright, stop playing,
Morty.

I-I got this.

Aah!

This is what we get
for evolving?

Sorry!
Sorry.

I-I'm sorry. We -- We --
We thought you were evil.

Why would you think that?

We had a giant tower
that blared "Glorzo is peace."

I know.
I -- Should -- Should we help?

- Boo!
- Oh, like that's helping.

Got it. Going.
Okay, we're gonna hit the road.

You're -- You're just going?You told us to go!

Once again,
I'm so sorry for what they --

You're part of this, too.
Boo!

We hate you the most.

Get out.

Jesus, Summer,
why'd you let these things

stay on us for so long?

I was working with a lot.

Just let me listen
to the podcast next time.

Nailed that landing.

Huh.
Neat-looking egg.

Okay, well, I'm not
cleaning up this shit.

Aah!

Maybe we, uh -- Maybe we don't
tell people about this one.

Did we at least
learn something?

That we suck
and everyone sucks?

I guess that counts.

Later, chodes.

Hit me on the next one.

You know, Rick,
I'm sure you wanna jump

into another crazy adventure,
but can we just relax

and maybe watch
some interdimensional cable?

I'm cool if you are.Honestly, that sounds great.

W-We don't need to try so hard,
you know.

Let's just take it easy
and riff, you know.

That's what I love about us.Me, too, buddy.

Do you suffer
from Alzheimer's?

Do you suffer from Alzheimer's?

Do you suffer
from Alzheimer's?

Do you suffer from Alzheimer's?

- Reggie?
- Do you suffer from Alzheimer's?

Reggie, you alright in there?

Mm, Rick, do you feel...

Oh, God,
I have to shit an egg.

Oh, my God, oh, shit.

Oh, it hurts.
Oh God,

is this how we die, Rick?
Is this how we die?!

I don't know, Morty.
I don't know! Aah!

- I don't want to shit an egg, Rick!
- I'm sorry, Morty.

I'm sorry! It's my fault.
It's all my fault!

Hey, you two. Did you --

Beth, your son is dying!
Say goodbye!

What are you --Say goodbye
to your little boy!

No, look away!

I'm making an egg, Mom.
I'm making an egg!

You said you'd keep me more
in the loop this year.

Look away, Beth!
Daddy loves you!

My ass!
My ass!

This is it, Morty!

It's full circle
from the pilot.

Full circle!

Oh, I guess we, uh --

I guess we both just had
to take a shit.

Yeah,
I-I-I guess we, uh...

Fucking gross.

Guys, clean it up.

Look at your dad.

Such a dork, keeping bees.

I mean, it's -- at least
it's interesting, though.

At least, like --
I wish my dad kept bees.

I mean,
it's kind of cute.

Like...
your dad keeps bees.

How old is your dad?

He's obviously
beekeeping age.

I don't know,
I think it's kind of sweet.

Summer, I want to
fuck your dad.

Oh, really?

﻿Why are we waiting in line
for food?

It's a pop-up.

It's a rare, pop-up
restaurant thing

that only enters
our solar system -- Rick.

You're gonna
spoil your appetite.

That's a weird way to say
I'm gonna stop being hungry

by eating food,
but whatever.

Three crispy,
uh, four wiggling.

You're probably not even hungry.
You just don't like lines

because they aren't
about you.

Another weirdly aggressive way
to describe a friend

respecting themselves.
-Eugh!

What a wonderful thing
to say!

Ha ha! I was merely inspired by
the wonderful thing you said!

Sirs? Guys?

You dropped this.

Please,
take it as a reward.

So courteous!

How nice it will be for you
to eat

what you were willing to stand
in line for so much sooner.

Oh, no, that's okay.

I came to stand in line
and then eat.

I-I wouldn't wanna do it
differently.

Hmm...

Dear fellow, I choose
this moment

to surrender my sword
so that you may succeed me

as the newest
Knight of the Sun.

What? No.

I-I-I didn't even want
your sandwich.

I don't want your sword.

Oh, believe me, son.

You want it.
I don't understand.

You're knights?
With a "K"?

Of the Sun with a "U"
or -- or an "O"?

Your alphabet
is of no concern here.

We are sworn defenders
of Helios,

the center
of this system.

Okay,
so it's "Sun" with a "U."

Oh, God.
Morty, don't take the sword.

Oh, I'm shocked you're
against something, Rick.

You know these guys?

I know how they're dressed
and how boring this sounds.

You take that sword,
you're gonna get sucked

into a whole complicated --

Oh, shit!

Come on, take it.

Uh...
I mean, if that kid's
not gonna take the sword...

He didn't offer it
to you.

Sorry. Can I just ask
some stuff?

W-What does
a Knight of the Sun do?

He takes the sword,
for one thing.

You know what?
Maybe you made a bad call.

He -- He doesn't want
the sword.

I didn't say that.

Well, you sure
aren't taking it.

Would you just take
a random --

Obviously I would, yes!
And I did!

Best decision
of my life!

And you're shitting on it!

Excuse me?
Is this just a free sword?

No!
I'm taking the sword.

Thank you, Dawnling.
What is your name?

Morty.

Now it is Sir Mortaniel.

I made it a little knightier.

Good day.

Wait, did he just --

God damn it, Morty!
You took the sword?

So boring!

Oh, like you're not
at this point?

You drunk cranky fuck!

Ouch.

You guys still
gonna stand in line?

Y-You're not gonna
take this food?

The pop-up pays us
to stand here.

To drive up business.

Knew it.

Everyone!

Sir Helios' successor,
Sir Mortaniel!

Sir Mortaniel,
face so bright

Serves the Sun with strength
and might

Sir Mortaniel, come and see

Just what the Sun provides
for thee

Wow, my -- my own song!

Now you know why Sir Helios
had to change your name

to something
with three syllables.

Welcome, Dawnling,
to the Sun!

So it is the Sun,
like Earth's sun?

Ah-ha,
he's heard of us!

How come I'm not, like,
burning to a crisp?

You are currently protected
by our powers,

but soon they will be yours.

Our flesh is indestructible!

Our lives are never-ending,
but not even in the dumb

vampire way where after a while
you hate it

and you can't die.

We can die whenever we want.

We just don't have to.

But you're not allowed
to leave, right?

L-Like, I'll -- I'll --
I'll never see my family again?

We leave constantly!

I met you on an asteroid.

Oh, yeah. Between us,
that wasn't a deal breaker,

but it's even better
that there's options.

You'll have more freedom
than you've ever known.

Our king.

The Sun is the center
of the solar system.

It is the home
of the solar Scepter,

around which
all worlds revolve.

The men who keep it safe are
admired by all and live as gods.

Any more questions?

Uh, yeah, where do I sign?

Huzzah.

Well, that does it.

Off to the parapet
to make this official.

Yeah,
let's do this.

Now just cut off your penises
and throw them into the Sun.

Oooooooookey-dokey.

I see Mortaniel wants
to go first.

Uh, not true.

Do I just leave the sword
wherever?

I-Is there a sword bin?

What are you saying?
You don't want to cut off --

Listen, guys, c-can we not --

It's a terrific
and painful sacrifice

we all make
for the most important

and powerful job
in the universe.

We've done it since
the dawn of dawns.

Yep.
There it is in stained glass.

It's official.
A-And I'm not judging it.

And I'm not doing it.

People
really live here?

This is nuts.
I thought it was a metaphor.

We have to go.

Ah. Boy.
They're not messing around, huh?

How are you not burning?

Oh, it's just science,

which,
unless I'm misinterpreting,

is clearly not
a priority here.

Okay, c'mon, lil' June bug.

I-I won't rub your face
in this one.

I-I'm guessing
you're feeling pretty stupid.

Yes. Thank you.

Sir Helios gave his life
with that sword.

Mortaniel took it.

He cannot leave unless
he bests me in combat.

Hmm.
Okay, uh, one sec.

I'm guessing these guys
are, like, pseudo-immortalish

since they live on the Sun,
so playing by their rules

might be the fastest way
out of this.

J-Just best him
in combat.

What?
Here.

This sword uses A.I. to learn
from an opponent's attacks.

So I have
to get attacked first?

No, no, no, the sword
has already seen "Blade."

And loved it.
You'll be fine.

-By golly!
-Ooh! Crikey!

Okay, so we're done here.

No. We're not done.

I am done.

You are
now king of the Sun.

Protect the Scepter
always.

No, no, no, no,
I don't want to!

Well, how is
that supposed to work?

He's king, but he was never
even a knight.

I mean, that's stupid.
Uh, it's --

it's definitely a...
Sun first.

A king with a penis?

Well, what do you want
from me?!

All hail King Mortaniel!

Uhhhhh, as your king,

I hereby declare a vacation,
for me.

I'll come visit you guys,
on, like, Sun Day...

Sundays.

If I forget,
just wait a week.

Keep doing that,
keep the crown. Peace.

Hell yeah. See?

That's from when
he's fighting Deacon Frost.

I don't know. Um,
I-I thought it was cool.

Okay. So...

So? Oh.

So, you dragged me
to a fake restaurant,

yelled at me for not
doing what you wanted,

then did something
I told you not to,

and it almost
cost you your pud,

but I saved your life,
and now you're waiting for me

to make you feel
like shit about it.

That's --
Yeah, you nailed it.

Morty, I'm sorry I let your
opinion of me get this low.

All right, I get it.

There's nothing to get.
I'm for real.

Look, I'm a drunk,
I'm a psychopath,

I'm a murderer, but...

when you called me boring...
I shouldn't have.

...I needed to hear it.

And you took the stupid sword,
and I was like, "Holy crap,

this is who I am
to this kid?

He just does the opposite
of my advice now.

I mean,
I-I gotta fix that."

So I'm gonna be, like, 22%

more agreeable
with you for, like,

maybe one episode,
or one adventure.

We'll see how it goes.
Is 22% a lot?

Well,
I-I'm not gonna tell you

what percentage
of our time together

I'm usually mean to you

because it'll hurt
your stupid feelings,

but 22% is substantial.

You're gonna feel
the difference.

Okay.
I mean, I-I appreciate it.

You should, because you made
a real mess with these guys.

Oh, man!

-Sire.
-You can't leave.

Go away!

My king, it is
our duty to follow you

till the sun sets
on our watch.

I mean, it set yesterday,
so you're done. Bye.

Sire, the sun never sets
on the Sun.

Can you get rid of them?

You want me to...
Well...

You guys know
he can kill you, right?

I think he'd find that
quite difficult, sire,

but if it pleases you.

Can't I just tell you it
pleases me for you to go away?

No. Not really.

So you'd rather die
than leave me alone?

Yes.

A pheasant plucked for
my good king

A merry jig,
sweet songbirds sing

These guys live on our sun?
I've never heard of them.

I don't see them doing a lot
to earn interplanetary fame.

I beg your pardon, wizard.

The Knights of the Sun
protect the solar Scepter...

around which even
this world turns.

You do mean that,
like, symbolically, right?

Oh, quite literally.

The Scepter is the center
of the solar system.

All planets orbit it.

We keep it on the Sun
so that

Jupiter and Saturn
don't bump into each other.

Omigod.
They don't even know
sixth grade science.

That's it!

Yeah, so there you have it.

Traditions suck ass,

and your
most foundational beliefs

are total bullshit.

We're supposed to take
your word for it?

Anyone can draw circles
on a board and spout numbers.

Yes, this sounds like
a fun theory, sire,

but it would take more than this
for us to give up --

Okay, so how do you guys
think it works again?

Well, the Scepter --
Oh, you mean this old thing?

Gaaah!
You want it?

Here.
Take it back home.

It's a symbol.
It's your culture.

That's not the same
as reality.

Does this mean
we cut off our penises

for absolutely no reason?

That's the bad news.

The good news is,
you're free.

-Ooh, that stings.
-Fuck this knights shit.

A query?

I just used your "computer
phone" to search "despair."

Where can I get
this heroin?

I'm not telling you that.

No matter. I'm seeing
from most of your song lyrics

that I can get it anywhere.

Um, you guys, someone just
used critical thinking

and basic physics to destroy
their first entire religion.

-Nice.
-Good job, Morty.

So no more sun-tourage?
Yep. All done.

Plus, Rick and I both learned
to support each other better.

So that's it.
We're done.

Feels early,
but w-we're done.

What's happening?

Appliances are breaking
that I haven't touched.

Maybe the sun is...
celebrating?

Ha ha ha ha! The Sons of the
Moon are storming the walkway.

Doesn't matter. Their aggression
will be kept in check

by a host of interplanetary
treaties and alliances.

It's very complicated,
but as long as The Knights

of the Sun stand together,
the solar system

will always have
complete political stability.

Where are the Knights
of the Sun,

by the way?
I'm done pooping.

Hmm?

Did the, uh,
Knights of the Sun...

disband?

While I was pooping?

Sunnnn-kward.

How many planets in our
solar system have these clowns?

I guess if the sun can support
life, any planet can.

I mean, maybe we all descended
from a common ancestor.

Haven't you seen, like,
all of the universes?

Exactly. So why would
I hang out on Pluto?

That's
some Jerry-league shit.

If the Sons of
the Moon can attack the sun,

why should the Viscounts

of Venus continue sitting
in Saturn's shadow?

How's this for a reason?

We got all the rings
and all the balls.

-Oh, fuck you.
-Really?

If the Saturno Venusian détente
is no longer honored,

I declare you all
moons of Jupiter.

Because
that's what you are to us!

A bunch of moons!

Do the Knights of the Sun
plan to protect

Mercury from this chaos?

Because if we're on our own,

there's a new,
very tiny sun in town.

It's all you, pal.

Um, hello?

Don't I have, like,
authority

over this
Sons of the Moon meeting?

That all depends.
Who the hell are you?

This guy's
the king of the Sun.

-Holy shit.
-When did this happen?

Ha! Then tell your knights
to do their jobs.

Yes, Your Majesty. We all know
the Sun's power lives

and dies with your knights.

Who are you?
Who am -- Who --

I am the Marquis of Mars!

And I declare war
on all of you!

War on all of you!

Where are the Knights of the Sun
when we need them most?

Funny you should ask, uh...

They're gone!

They've abandoned
their duties.

I see it in the bones.

Damn,
the bones nailed it.

Okay, so you have space ships
and magic ladies?

Look, I'm not gonna read
all the books.

What will it take
to let this

Sons of the Moon fiasco
resolve itself?

Excuse me. How did you become
king of the Sun?

You look like an Earthling.

Santa?
Santa?

What the hell is that?

I'm the Earl of Earth,
god damn it.

I agree with Earth
on one thing --

Venus questions the legitimacy
of this king's authority.

My people say I say aye.

I'm the king.

I've got the Scepter
right here.

What the fuck?

Yeah, yeah, I know
you're freaking out

because it's not on the sun.

No, because whoever has it

rules the solar system!

It's up for grabs!
Get it!

After it! Ahhhh!

Yes, yes.
I have the Scepter.

Soon Jupiter will be the center
of our solar system's

newest dark ages.
Fuck that.

Mercury will now be
the shining beacon of --

Time to throw it
all against the wall.

I think you crushed it.

I mean, not just anybody
can start Solar War One.

Stop supporting me.
Can do.

Goodbye, blue sky

Goodbye, blue sky

Goodbye

Goodbye

Did, did, did, did you see
the frightened ones?

Did, did, did, did you hear
the falling bombs?

Did, did, did, did you
ever wonder why

We had to run for shelter
when the promise

Of a brave new world unfurled
beneath a clear blue sky?

Ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

Ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

Did, did, did, did you see
the frightened ones?

Did, did, did, did you hear
the falling bombs?

The flames are all long gone,
but the pain lingers on

Goodbye, blue sky

Goodbye, blue sky

Goodbye

Goodbye

Damn, who would have thought
giving the Amish nukes

would threaten
the solar system?

Maybe we should just
jump universes.

I don't know, buddy.
Feels like we're kind of more

about trying out
commitment now, ya know?

Let's put our heads together.

Maybe there's something
we haven't tried yet.

Oh, here's an idea.
Fuck you!

Hey!
Rick, I can't take it.

I admit I'm wrong, I screwed up.
You're killing me here

yes-and'ing me to death.

What is this,
"Vat of Acid" again?

Look, man, I'm sorry I've been
such a dick in the past

that you think
I'm doing a thing here.

I'm honestly just trying
to do better by you.

Are you a robot?

Morty!
A clone?

Morty, this family's got enough
clones and robots in it.

Come on, Morty, stop asking
what you're asking

and let's just get back
to our crisis.

I'm sorry. It's just been
a hard road with you, Rick.

Morty, I get that,
but you can trust me

when I say I'm just trying
to do right by you.

Okay, Rick.
You're right. Maybe...

maybe I just need
to round up some Knights.

If I disillusioned
the old ones,

I'll just have
to re-illusion them.

It shouldn't be that hard,
right?

Cousins, we need to return
to the walkway at once.

Why are you laughing?
Did I say something funny?

Oh, Mortaniel.

The only person we bend
the knee to these days

is that sweet Black Betty.

Yeah, man, all hail
Mr. Brownstone.

And his doctor.
Feelgood, that is.

They're talking about heroin,
Morty. They like it.

Obviously.
Obviously?!

Apparently living on the Sun
has turned our veins

into triple-bonded carbon,

so try this tale on for size,
Mortaniel...

we can't OD!

C'mon, you guys
are a mess.

Well, they actually
seem kinda awesome, Morty.

Lemme be your king.

I admit, I wanted what you
once had --

brotherhood, tradition,
stability, purpose.

I just...didn't want to cut
my dick off for it.

Yeah, that's the point.

We were quick to follow
this boy before,

without even forcing him
to commit to our traditions.

And all he did was break
our faith and our walkway.

And now
this random fucking guy

is here again
to tell us what to do?

No fucking way!

What if I cut off my dick?

But you'd be cutting it off
for no reason.

Yeah, that's the point
of tradition --

doing things for no reason,

but it'd be reason enough
doing it for you guys.

Well, you do that,
that would compete with heroin.

Cool, cool. Can
I maybe get a minute?

Buddy, what's up?

Reaching some sad conclusions
about your situation?

Yes, but that walkway needs
those knights,

those knights need a king,
and that king needs no dick.

Damn, Morty, you really
are stepping up.

Now do you want me
to help you

not have to cut
your dick off, though?

Yes, please.
Then I got you.

Uh, you really mean it,
Rick?

Of course, buddy.
I'll give you a fake dick

with three layers
of fail-safes.

They'll never know
the difference.

Shh, Morty.

We're gonna make your dick
so fake, buddy.

The signal! Sir, the Knights
of the Sun are once more.

Hold fire.

If this return to the Old Ways
is true,

I'd be willing to return home
and put an end to the bloodshed.

Sir? Shall we hold off on the
antimatter hydrogen bombing?

Those crusty
knights won't do the Sun

much good without their --

Hoo!

Let's hear them out.

I, Lithdor, son of Thrifdor,
personally oversee

the stumping
of thy king's stem.

If his stem burns true,

peace will be restored
between the spheres.

Yay!

Present the Shears of Stumping!

-Morty the Brave!
-You got this, my king!

First things first.
Step through this machine

which checks for
nanotechnological

hologram dicks.
What?!

War opened our eyes to
the wonders of new technologies.

Please, step through,
my liege.

Whew!

Sorry, my lord,
but we're gonna need you

to step through
this second machine,

which checks
for emergency clone dicks.

Oh, wow, you guys
really embraced

a lot of specific
new tech, huh?

Whoa, a sunspot!
What? Where?

Boy, is -- is that a
third detector I see, as well?

You'll find out after
the second one.

We don't like
to reveal them

until the previous detecting
threshold has been crossed.

Right.

The third detector is going
to scan for a prosthetic dick.

Oh. Ha ha. Good.

Okay, well, go on through,
and, of course, by "prosthetic"

we mean witchcraft dick.

-Shit.
-I sense one.

The bones say
he's still packin'.

Ha ha, can't get nothin'

past the chicken bone lady.

J-Just testing her.

Stump. Thy. Stem.

Morty?
Morty, don't answer out loud.

Can you hear me? It's Rick. I'm
talking to you with my mind.

Yeah, I can hear you.

You said that out loud.
Don't speak.

Sorry.
Sorry.

I uplinked a telepathic
nano satellite

so we could hear
each other's thoughts.

Carefully do everything
I tell you

in the exact order
I tell you to do it.

Okay.
Grab the scissors.

Okay.
Got the scissors.

Now...run!

Oh, shit, shit!

Guards, seize them!

Run? You
couldn't have just said that?!

You don't have to use
telepathy anymore.

You can just ask your
rhetorical questions out loud.

I don't understand, Rick.

Here's something that's easy
to understand, buddy --

I'm proud of you for trying
to solve your own shit.

Ugh, I didn't want
to have to do this.

It's okay this time.
We don't have any choice.

I love you, Rick.

Love you, too, buddy.

Whoooooaaa!

And that's when
King Morty and Rick

were left with no choice
but to leap into the Sun.

Such shame he felt for what
he'd done to our society,

sacrificing his dick
wasn't enough --

He gave his entire body
and wizard servant, as well.

And after a while,
their sun-proof bones

floated up to the top.

We even checked with
a royal ladle

to ensure it was real sun,

not just them hiding beneath
in a vat of fake sun.

Such a violent death.

And finally when our grief
could bear no more,

we decided to abolish our
medieval act of stem stumping.

And we have
King Morty the Molten

to thank for that.

Morty the Molten!

King Morty the Molten!

See, Morty?
Worked like a charm.

Aren't we risking it
all coming back here?

Morty, we had to know.
Plus the heat --

It's good for my joints.
-King Mortaniel?!

You're alive?!

Yeah, go tell everybody.

Your reward's gonna be
cutting off your own dick.

Right.
Point taken.

R.I.P. and cheerio.

Whew!

One crispy,
one wriggling.

Coming right up.

Three loozums.

How 'bout ten years?

In jail.

Huh?
Special Agent Mongo Bongo.

You're under arrest for
illegal hot dog trafficking.

Oh!

Be free, my little babies.

Ahh!

Huh.
Surprised they actually made it.

Kinda thought maybe some birds
would swoop down --

Aaahhhhh! Aah!

I jinxed it. Aah!

Did you get any of that?

﻿Wait, what's that?

Do I hear something
coming down the chimney?

Rick Santa-chez here with gifts
from across the multiverse!

Oh, my God!
Yes!

For Jerry,
an extradimensional version

of "Miracle on 34th Street."

Two hours longer!

They fixed my only problem
with it!

For Beth, a framed photo
of the two of us from a universe

where she wasn't murdered
as a child.

Oh, my God.
Dad.

And for Space Beth,
the same thing because we --

we don't know
which one of you is real.

I am
also touched.

Summer,
c-check your Venmo.

Ah! Money?
How did you know?

You're 17.

And last but not least,

for my number one
number two.

Morty you asked for this
a long, long time ago

and I finally went far,
far away enough to get it

since shipping
would have killed me.

You didn't!
No fucking way.

No fucking way.

Does it make
the noises?

Of course it "makes the noises."
That's like half the fun.

Ha ha!
Awesome!

Whoa, do not turn that on!
Don't worry.

Morty's only gonna use
this very honorable weapon

in designated Jedi zones --
like the garage right now!

Ah! Ohhhh!

Holy crap!

I hate to say it, but I wish
there was something to attack.

Yeah, it's too bad nobody
bought a cart of fruit!

You beautiful
son of a bitch!

Grapefruit!
Mango!

Papaya! Watermelon!

A second papaya!
Another watermelon!

Strike me down.
What?

Strike me down!
I'm not striking you down.

Strike me down, Morty!

I-I'll become a pile of clothes
like that old guy!

But you'll die.
You're drunk.

Here, I'll --
I'll do it myself.

No!

Ha ha, wow, you did it!
Just like Obi-Wan.

Rick?
Y-You can come out now.

I'm serious.

Did you, like,
become your clothes?

Are you T-shirt Rick now?

Psst.
Over here, buttfart.

Hoo, that was awesome!
Right?!

Rick, you know,
y-y-you've been

so great
the last couple months.

The family's so happy.
I'm -- I'm really grateful.

Aw, thanks, kid, but less
talk, more melon slinging!

Heads up!
Whoops!

Oh shit, shit, shit.

Open it, Rick!
Let me do it!

Get up. Get --
Fucking move!
Hurry!

Oh!
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

You dropped it perfectly
vertical, Morty!

P-Perfectly
fucking vertical!

I got it, I got it!
Aww!

Ah, shoot.

Shit.

Elevator!
Elevator!

We gotta
get ahead of it!

L-Level 10?
No, no, no! 15!

Wait, we live over
a cool sushi spot?

Domo, domo.
Not now, though.

Okay, we overshot it.
Good problem to have.

Still doing the eel roll?

I told you we should've
gone to 10!

No, Morty, not 10!

Morty, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait!

Let me out.

What the fuck?

Rick?!

You dumb fucking robot.
You had one job!

Hey, that job was to be
a good grandpa,

I-I go
where the kid goes.

Don't touch me!

How long have I --
you said you weren't a robot!

It killed me to lie to you,
Morty.

But it would have literally
killed me not to lie to you.

Betrayal!
Betrayal on all sides!

Don't overreact, Morty.

I-I replaced myself
towards the beginning

of that whole
Knights of the Sun thing.

I-I'm no good to anybody

until I resolve
this archnemesis crap.

You're still hunting the guy
who killed your wife?

You don't have to rub it in,
Morty.

T-That's why I removed myself.

I've become the thing I hate.

I-It's like a Netflix drama
down here,

and I don't mean
an accidentally good one,

I mean
a regular-ass Netflix drama.

I did you a favor.

Y-You gave him a fuckin'
lightsaber for Christmas?!

It's almost like
someone designed me

to be 22% more thoughtful
than you.

All right, that's it,
I'm shutting you down.

Don't you dare.
Y-You've done enough.

The whole family, Rick.
Everybody loves...this thing.

Oh, good.
By the way, your lightsaber's

probably run out of sub-basement
by now, so, congrats.

Unbelievable.

I can't believe you tricked us
into loving you!

Not because I like it.
It's because it's my job.

But thank God I don't have to
do it anymore.

The fuck you don't.
It's Christmas!

Get up there and trick
everyone into loving you more!

Let's get our "Miracle" on.

Speaking of miracles...

What, bored of your toy
already?

Just, uh, excited to spend
time with my family.

Y-You know me and Morty.
We're all about those streets.

Oh, would you look at this!
New York City!

Wow, who would have thought
it had so many streets?

And avenues too.
Oh, gosh!

Hey, sir, sir.
Have you seen any miracles?

My little girl, she's sick
and she needs a miracle.

The presidential Black Hawk
is landing on the lawn.

I'll get rid of him.

You got something
to tell me, Morty?

Merry Christmas?

Who dropped a lightsaber
perfectly fucking vertical?

Oh, sh--

Guess what, numb nuts.

It's a mile deep
and still going.

You know what's in the hilt
of that thing?

Kyber crystals!
Okay, nerd.

Whatever it is,
when it hits the core,

it's gonna cause
a chain reaction

that destroys the Earth!

I-It is?

Why are you still playing
with laser swords anyway?

You're 14!

You know all that Star Wars
shit is silly, right?

Lucas promised a new trilogy
for decades.

Then, when he delivered,
fans turned on him

and started giving
any knucklehead
with nerd cred a shot

and churned out
these irredeemable cash grabs.

Half pretend to be satisfied,
half shit on it,

and in the end
no one's happy.

Do you know why, Morty?

Because when you start
with a turd,

you end with a turd.

Why you crying?
Where's Rick?

He's busy.
A-And I hate him.

And I lost my lightsaber,
and now it might destroy Earth

and you're unloading
all this Gen X hatred on me

for even wanting one, and i-it's
the worst Christmas ever!

Okay, M-Morty, Morty,
Morty, Morty.

I shouldn't have talked to you
like you're a UN official.

Let's get your
embarrassing-ass lightsaber back

so you can swing it around
instead of kissing girls.

Whoa, ho ho, you found me --
found me -- found me!

Security breach.

What the hell?

Unauthorized presence.

What the fuck Morty?!

This morning,
a real-life version

of George Lucas's
trademarked lightsaber

was dropped point down
and is whomp-whomping its way

to the core of the Earth,
where it will blow us all up.

Touch my shit and die.

That's not a threat from me,
that's how advanced my shit is.

Impressive lair,
Sanchez.

Got about 600,000 permits?

If I wanted the government
in my house, I'd buy an Alexa.

I invited him in, Rick.

Yeah, well, they can leave.
I'll destroy it.

We're gonna retrieve it.

Well, that's stupid.

What kind of grandfather
are you?

It's Christmas,
for God's sake,

and you look like Phil Spector
wiped his ass with Randy Quaid.

If you're gonna help, help.
Otherwise step aside.

Merry Christmas to me.

Merry Christmas to me!
To me!

Anyhoo, I'm no expert
but it seems we've got a --

a certain amount of time
to build a big drill ship.

A big drill ship?

That's some pretty loud
stepping aside you're doing.

Just let me destroy
the thing!

You've destroyed enough!

Ooooh!

Aah!

Oh, I see someone found
my "told you so" dispenser.

Oh, my God,
look at all these streets!

We got 34th Street!
35th Street!

Oh, 36th Street coming too!

Oh, it's a miracle!
We got miracles on 37th Street!

38th! And don't even get me
started on the avenues!

I can't believe
they cut this!

Mm-hmm.

Dad, you've been
so great lately.

I'm almost afraid
it's not real.

You're not a robot,
are you?

Ha!
Put it this way, honey --

If I am,
I-I'm a robot

programmed to love you
very, very much.

Aww!

Will this drill down fast enough
to get under the lightsaber?

Yep, it will be under
the lightsaber in one hour

because the --
wait, it's lower now.

Oh, right, it's moving.

You fucking idiot.
Get out of here!

Good luck finding
a good scientist on Christmas!

I'm President of
the United Assholes.

All right, genius,
I give you permission

to make
our drill ship faster.

I'm not touching
that thing.

I'll get
neurotypical cooties.

I have son-in-laws
more imaginative.

All right, j-just destroy
the lightsaber!

Thought you'd never ask.
Not true. I knew you'd ask.

What is that?

A second lightsaber
with an A.I.-controlled

gyroscopic rocket
in the hilt.

You had a lightsaber?!
Oh, did you want one?

What a terrible gift
that would have made.

Vertisaber,
state your prime directive.

To stay vertical.
Then show 'em how it's done.

Affirmative.

Whoo! America!
Yeah! Oh, yeah.

Maintain verticality,
Vertisaber.

Affirmative.

All right, looking good.
Stay on target.

Uh-huh.

Progress report.

Vertisaber,
do you copy?

Do I have to respond
every time?

Excuse me?

I'm designed
to stay perfectly vertical,

not to give
constant affirmation.

You do your job,
I'll do mine.

I control you!

Okay, I'll just turn off
my brain and you can do that.

Byyye!

Fucking kidding me?
Shit!

Trajectory's drifting,
sir.

Where is
it coming out?

Looks like Italy, sir.

Okay, t-that
could've been worse.

Aah!

Well, uh, that is
definitely not amore.

Way to show us
how it's done, Rick.

Whatever.

Italian prime minister
on line one.

Put him on hold.
We can pin this on the Saudis.

This is something
they'd do.

They may as well have done it.
They did do it.

Oh, there's another miracle
at the end of the intersection

of 401st Boulevard
and 7,000th Street!

That's a miracle per block
so far.

Okay, even I am nearing
my limit.

Let's play
a Christmas game!

Oh.
Uh, um...

have you guys ever played
"Are You a Robot?"

Each person here
has to decide

whether or not
t-they're a robot.

Ohh,
I'm gonna play that.
Yes, yes, yes.

But don't say it out loud.

Because if you're a robot,
you're not allowed to say
you are.

T-T-That's the rule.

That's the horrible, painful
thing about being a robot.

But you do have to answer
everyone's questions.

And it's their jobs to decide
whether you are

or aren't a robot, because --

because if you are
a robot you can't say!

You're not allowed
to say at all.

I'll go first!
Uh, question.

Oh!
Ahh, are you a robot?

Can I just ask that?
You can!

But don't forget that if I am,
I have to lie

even though I don't want to.

More questions?

Can you feel things?

Oh, fuck yes! Yes!
T-That's the problem!

If I'm a robot,
which I'm not --

don't forget
I have to say that --

but yes,
yes, I feel so much.

I'm filled with love
for certain people,

but also filled with shame

if I'm programmed
to deceive them,

but that's a big if.

What's your skeleton
made of?
Titanium!

You're -- You're a robot!

Yes!
No!

But that's what a robot
would say!

So, you get the idea.

Whoo!
Suck it, bitches!

This is fun!

I've always been afraid
to let my guard down

and just have stupid
family fun like this,

but Grandpa Rick is making me
learn to be vulnerable!

Right on!
Me too!

Ohh!
Mm!

All right,
your derivative drill ship

is now faster
than a lightsaber.

Morty, y-you want front
or back?

Who says the two of us
are going?

Y-You didn't even want to --

Oh, for fuck's sake.
Bye!

Good luck.
Don't blow up my planet.

You act like you're the one
that got stabbed in the back!

Because I am the one, Morty.

You want to know
why I replaced myself

in the beginning
of that stupid

Knights of the Sun
thing?

I said don't take
the fucking sword,

and you were like
"whatever,"

like I'm our neighbor Gene
or David Arquette or something.

You called me boring.

I've become
dog shit to you.

That's what happens
when you let people in

and they stop
respecting you.

They touch your shit,
they screw things up,

they kill
your fucking family.

Go ahead.
Trust him.

You're gonna learn
the same fucking thing.

I...am not going to kill
your family, Morty.

That means a lot.

In case this goes south,
any last words, Morty?

I've never been old enough
to vote, Mr. President,

but when I am,
I'll vote for you.

Thanks, Morty.
Every vote counts.

If you want, I can have them
legally change your age.

Uh, no, I-I'm not in any hurry
to get into that shit show.

Approaching the lightsaber
in T-minus -- oh, shit, now.

T-minus now!
Sorry!

I missed countdown day
at the academy.

Now or never, Morty!

There it is!

Reverse the jets!

I got this!

Ugh!

No...I do!

Morty, you magnificent
little bastard!

Let's get this thing
topside.

May the force be with...
me!

I think you mean
with me.

What?
You hate Star Wars.

I was your age when this shit
was in theaters.

This franchise raised me,

trained me,
taught me good from evil,

made having
a bad father empowering.

And when that third movie
got all...muppety,

something in me
began to rot.

But make no mistake,
child,

I own Star Wars,
not you.

Not that bubble-throat
pompadour fuck,

not some Mickey Mouse
shit machine.

They didn't pay the price
with their souls.

I did!
I earned this, not you!

America,
transform and roll out!

Bastard!

Rick,
I would be honored

if you would
carve the ham this year.

Whoa. Dad.
That's --

Unheard of?
You're quite right, Summer.

It's my way of saying
I see your mom's father

as my father too.

Ohh, Jerry,
w-w-why don't you cut it?

Geez, Dad, what the hell
are you doing?

He's like adopting you into
his biological family, Grandpa.

Morty, I am sure glad
to see you.

Y-Y-You ready to tag
your old grandpa back in?

You're not my grandpa.
You're a fucking robot.

Finally.

The first Noel

The angels did say

Was to certain
poor shepherds

In fields as they lay

Okay, okay, okay.

Oop!

Aww!

Summer, do you have
any drugs?

Are you serious?
I guess not.

I'm just glad I'm not the one
that ruined Christmas.

People of Earth...
Hmm, that's never good.

I'm not here to play
the blame game

but Morty Smith got
a lightsaber for Christmas,

dropped it,
and it's now heading

for the Earth's core again --
I-I mean for the first time.

Son of a bitch!
He played with it!

If it does reach the core,
it will blow all of you up.

I-I mean all of us up.

But don't abandon hope.

We're doing everything
we can to stop it,

and only if that fails

will we launch
the White House into space...

Welp, I'm busted.
Clearly in space already.

You did ruin Christmas.

Nunh-unh! He stole my lightsaber
and must've dropped it!

A-A second time!

Does that mean you stopped it
a first time?

How?
A drill ship.

A drill ship?
Awesome!

It was, but the government
took it with them.

Then we lean on the only asshole
smart enough

to make another one
in this tight a window

But Rick's gone.

And I'm not sure
he's ever coming back.

Then let's settle
for the next best thing.

Oh, fuck!
Just let me die!

Turn me off --
not that I can be turned off

because I'm obviously
not a robot!

Fuck yeah!
I got you.

Okay, I can --
I can work with that.

Aaaah!

What do you mean the White House
chef was grocery shopping?

Well, do you know
how to make an egg?

You do?
Everyone does?

Good news, sir.

The lightsaber was intercepted
before it hit the core.

All right, here we go!
Ha ha!

I don't suppose you could
send it up here.

Uh, who intercepted it,
anyway?

That's the bad news.

That is bad news.

Hey, Mister P.
Drop something?

Morty! I see you and, uh, Rick
patched things up.

That's nice.

No, the real Rick and I
have never been worse

thanks to that wedge you drove
between us

just to get
that lightsaber!

Yeah, well, looks like
you got it back.

Your journey is complete.
As a nerd!

You're the nerd!

You can't say
all that crazy shit

about Star Wars
and then act like you're cool!

Oh, really? Would a person who
wasn't cool have one of these?

I think so?

Slowly closing door!
Slide!

Oh, no!
I-I'm not gonna make it.

What a shame to be put out
of my misery again.

Aw, man.

What the hell?

W-Was this always part
of the White House?

Carter built it
with his own two hands.

Reagan tried to destroy it.

George W. added kegs
to the cantina.

But only I
saw its true value.

Mr. President,
you need to come home

and tell the people
the truth.

The fuck I do.
Droids, get that saber!

Give it a minute.

Usually comes out
on the fourth try.

All right!
Here we go!

Look at 'em --
lightsaber hands!

Tell me that's not cool.
It's not!

I always wanted to fight with
a lightsaber, but not like this.

Y-You ruined it!

Disney ruined it!

You think I want 30 low-rent
TV series with bad CGI?

They film everything on that
one big green screen.

Like you've got better ideas.

I've got a million.

Here's one -- a robot
with lightsabers for eyes!

God damn it,
he can't see!

It was a good idea
otherwise.

Uh, admit it,
you were intimidated.

Uh, now, Morty...

Come on, put down
the lightsaber Gatling gun.

We had our fun, right?

Star Wars rules say
you have to forgive me.

I-I'm done with that,
and I'm done with you!

Morty, nooo!

Rickbot!

He sacrificed his life
for me.

Yeah, don't be too touched,
he's actively trying to die.

Ugh.
I-It's okay. It doesn't hurt.

Oh, God, t-they're sliding,
Morty!

T-They're sliding!
They're sliding!

The first Noel

The angels

Perfectly
fucking vertical.

Ohh!

Ooh!

Save yourself, Morty!
Rick can build another me.

If -- If I was a robot,
w-which I'm not.

I don't want
another you.

Nooo!

Rick?
You came to help!

Better tend
to your little toaster.

I -- I'm
I'm coughing up oil, Morty.

Oh, Rickbot, I-I never
should've pushed you away.

Y-You were --
you were so great.

Of course I'm great.
I'm Rick.

Rick literally built
me to make you happy, Morty.

Anything I do is technically
something Rick did.

But maybe he can do
a little more him-- himself.

God, how long do you take
to die?

Goodbye, Morty.
Uh...

Ugh, Jesus.

Uh, Rick, uh...

I guess this is a bad time
to ask for a new White House?

Morty, would you mind
calling me an Uber?

Right, well, uh...

Merry Christmas.

I guess I'll go watch
a guy scream

about streets
with the family.

Also, you need
to shower.

Hey,
maybe the robot's right.

I-I should have
included you in my shit.

You can help me
if you want.

Wow, are those all the places
Rick Prime could be?

I wish, Morty.
It's all the places he is.

Oh, geez.

Welcome to my darkness.

I spent my life
hunting this guy, Morty!

This is the closest I've ever
been to catching Rick Prime.

it's impossible!

He -- He's an incredibly
crafty piece of shit.

Hunting him
destroyed me, Morty!

But now we're gonna
do it together! You and me!

Oh! Uh...
It's gonna take
over your life, Morty!

Rick and Morty, season seven,
hunting my nemesis!

Maybe trying to stay healthy
while doing it!

Juggling plates!
And not every episode, Morty!

It could be all happening
in the background! Who knows?

You know, n-no one will,
except us!

I-It's the most painful shit
I've ever had to deal with

and I'm fucking
bringing you into it

because you asked for it,
Morty!

You and me, Morty!

Ooo-wee!
What a season, huh?

Rick Prime!
Therapy!

And that thing we did with Roy.
Remember thaaat?

Sorry I wasn't around,

been busy getting
my little poopybutt in shape.

Been tonin' and bonin'!
Whew!

Y-You might think I'm over-
compensating for the emptiness

after Amy left with Poopy Jr.,
but my trainer

Caaarl says the best way
to get over a girl

is to get under
a 300-pound squat.

Damn right.
Ha!

Oo-wee,
that's the good stuff!

Oh, sugar! Oh, sugar!
Oh, sugar!

Oh, is it -- is it bad?

Oh! It's -- It's really bad,
isn't it?

Oh, sug-- oh!

Someone call Amy,
tell her I need her.

Tell her I love her!

Not my phone. She blocked me.
U-Use yours.

Oo-weee!
I am broken!

Did you get any of that?

Tickets, please.

Barkeep. A drink
for my colleague.

Do I know you?

I know the only reason
to travel by train

is to travel
with weapons.

And we all know that
at the end of this line,

there's only one creature
worth killing.

The man in
the white coat.

May as well take turns
exchanging stories.

Mine begins
on planet Ramamama.

Lower him into acid.

Once he's dissolved,
lower someone else into acid.

Is he dissolved?

At least use the downtime
to reset the acid lowerer.

I really don't like
the attitude around here.

It's a very "lower me into acid"
attitude.

Who are you?

How did you
reach my sanctum?

All right,
this is going in circles.

Seize him!

- Aah!
- Aah!

- Aah!
- Aah!

Very well.

Now Iwill fight you.

Anyway, he tells a different
version of the story

where I start crying
or something.

That's why he has to die.

'Cause he's a liar.

So...

why are you going to kill
Rick Sanchez?

Okay, I don't know
who that is.

I don't accept your weird
leap in logic

that has everyone on a train
going to kill one guy.

And even if I did,
why would we take turns

telling stories
about it like

little girls
at a sleepover?

If you're trying
to be hurtful,

you're doing a good job.

I'll take his turn.

Here's why I'm going
to kill Rick Sanchez.

You guys have fun
with this.

Dissolve to
a clam-shaped sun

rising over
a giant beach.

Whew.

By then, of course,
he had left toys

and flesh drops for every
one of us in the spore-hive.

Ah, a newcomer!

I suppose you think you have
a better story

about how Rick Sanchez
saved Space Christmas.

What is with
the Rick Sanchez obsession?

I think the best way
to answer that

is with my
Christmas Rick Tale.

Whoo!

Could've used
Rudolph tonight!

Oh, thank God.
I'm not too late.

I don't know how to
thank you, Goomby.

No need.

You just go in there
and have a nice time.

I will. Thanks.

Hey.

Merry Christmas, Goomby.

Merry Christmas, Rick.

Oh. Uh...

Oh, it's okay.

I-I don't have to.
Sorry if that was --

No. Um, um,
I can ask.

No, no, no,
I don't wanna be a burden.

Oh, okay.
Yeah, yeah, there's just --

there's a lot of people.
Family. You know?

I get it.

You're not mad?Totally fine.

Bye.

That --
Okay, none of my business

but he didn't even save
Christmas in that story.

Oh, how dare you!

That doesn't mean
I'm invested.

Tell your
Christmas Rick story!

Step the hell back!
Back!

You start teeing up
a Rick Sanchez vignette,

and you'll be doing it
through two holes.

I'm just trying to figure out
what's going on with this train.

Do you remember
getting on it?

No. First thing
I remember is...

Tickets, please.

So, why did you date
Rick Sanchez?

What?

Oh, you don't have to pretend
you didn't date him.

We all did.
We get it.

Low point in your life,
rebound from an ex, et cetera.

No, really, who?

Oh, exactly.

In fact, and get this,
when he met myfamily...

Aah!

Leah!
Leah, check it out.

Where'd you meet
this, um...

...sprite?

He's actually a human.

But he invented portal tech?

I am the concept
of time.

Jesus!

I warned you
not to do that.

I wasn't trying.You don't have to.

The train is
obviously amplifying

and linking unrelated
narrative fields.

Uh-huh...

Morty? I told you if you
found me again,

identify yourself.

I didn't
know it was you.

How did you not
recognize me?

Didn't you create
the disguises?

When I create shit,
it works, Morty.

It's called
being talented.

Why can't
we find the engine?

It's not a real train,
it's a story device.

Literally.
A literal literary device

quite literally
metaphorically containing us.

A simulation.

Worse.
An anthology.

Okay, so how --
how do we hijack it?

Oh, Morty,
it's been hijacked

for at least
two full minutes.

Are you not hearing
this insane conversation?

Okay, Tickets Please Guy,
stop the anthology.

If we wanted one-offs,
we'd do Interdimensional Cable,

not some uptight,
overwritten --

Rick?
God damn!

Tickets, please.

Dude, I'm sure
you've got, like,

so many tickets
at this point.

Jesus! The Tickets Please guy
is cut!

He -- he -- he's -- he's
got those things.

W-what do you call them.
Uhm, cum gutters.

Morty, gross!That's what people call them.

Gross people. I don't
want to have to picture

cum so watery
in such volumes that --

Hey, hey, hey,
stay back.

I'll kick you.
I-I'll kick your shin, bro.

Aaah!
Hey!

I'll fuckin' cook and eat
your ticket-taking ass.

Hey, I found a ticket.

Wow, you are just --
ladies and gentlemen,

the Jackie Chan
of human shielding.

Who takes the time to get
this good at --

Fuck this.

- Aaah
- Structural breach.

Losing continuity.

Morty,
hold on to something.

Keep your head inside.

Aaah!

Share with your
sister, Josh.

Just because it's your
birthday doesn't mean

you can be an asshole.

You okay, Dad?Is this real?

I doubt it, but you get
what you get

when you eat dinner
in an arcade.

I mean are you real,
is life real?

Okay, I'm calling the nurse
because you are not

doing this tonight.You're God damn right

I'm not because --You are not doing this tonight!

This isn't real life!

Dad? Oh, my God!Honey. Sweetie.

What's happening?Give me your tickets.

I -- I need tickets.

Everyone give me
tickeeeeeettttttts!

Aaaah!

Aaah!

Emergency continuity deployed.

This could come in handy.Can't we just ride out the --

Fuck you,
I'd rather die.

Train cops! Hands in the air!

Tee up a story
about Rick Sanchez!

He isRick!
Jesus Christ!

Is that
the Tickets Please Guy?

Well, just the stub.

Too soon!
Too soon!

Don't move! Too soon!

So, what did the Train Cops
do wrong?

Shot...people?

Shot passengers.
Wrong.

The passengers tampered
with the anthology's structure.

Lethal response
was permitted,

but not with him
holding that tank.

Let's take a look at what
they should have done.

Train cops!
Hands in the air!

Drop the tank!Drop it!

Drop it! Drop the tank.

Sorry to nitpick, sir,
but if there was

a continuity explosion,
isn't there always one?

And doesn't that mean
those two could be anywhere?

What? No, you idiot,
that -- it's --

It's just a training video.
That didn't actually happen.

That's what you think.

Hey.
How'd you get here?

Yeah, like we're the ones
that popped up out of nowhere?

Fuck these guys.

Hey, what the hell?
Your leg is healed.

Yeah, it's a real
free-for-all.

Here we go.

Of course this thing is
just a fucking circle.

You'd think it was so
God damn complicated --

Okay, here's where
the stupid vignettes were.

God, imagine if that
had been the whole thing.

So now we're here,
and the engine must be here.

I'll have to rig us
a couple of space suits

that start failing
around here so we can

pay a heavy price

for re-entering
at this threshold.

We have to
leave the train?

We don't haveto
do anything, Morty.

This is just
a structural guide.

We're obviously gonna
impart our own style.

I don't like how meta
this is getting, Rick.

Shut up, Morty.
You're 14.

You watch videos
of people on YouTube

reacting to
fucking YouTube.

I'll be the judge of
when we get too meta.

Holy shit.

How is he still breathing?Aah!

He's suspended
in disbelief,

slowly dying while
living out an alternative

non-diagetic reality.

Geez, what a horrible
way to die.

You don't know
the half of it.

Oh!

You're on fuego with the
guy-torn-in-half bits, Rick.

That one was
organic, though.

That's because
you're naturally funny.

That -- that's good
old-fashioned fun

right there, you know?

W-w-we don't need
to over-think shit, okay?

Okay, buddy.
Nice and grounded,

fully immersive
from here on out.

Right after this.W-what's happening?

Going into an act break.

♪ Not quite a bird

♪ Not quite a person

♪ Maybe what matters

♪ Is to love
yourself first and ♪

♪ Soar

♪ Child of air and land

♪ With wings and hands

♪ Yes, you're a bird
and a person ♪

♪ I'm a bird
and a person ♪

♪ And more

Sure, that was
a great moment,

but it was hardly
the best time

Rick and Morty
were musical.

Who can
forget the t--

Hey. You guys
think there's something weird

about this train?

We've been here
a really long time

and nobody's
taken our tickets.

Aaah!

Aaaah!

The galaxy's greatest scientists
continue to ponder

the horrific figure known
to children as Floaty Blood Man.

But after three months, nobody
is any closer to the truth.

For Cutesy Name News,
I'm Uncle Nibbles.

I can't believe
Floaty Bloody Man is real.

He's more than real,
he's my new god.

Check it.
Is that brand-new,

or is the blood just --Accurately depicted, yeah.

His followers believe
the entire universe

is Floaty Bloody Man's
nightmare as he dies

in a time-dilated
reality.

So we could
go at any minute.

No. I'm part of
the Floaty Nogasm Brotherhood.

We believe we're
keeping him alive

by redirecting our suppressed
sexual energies.

You're staying a virgin

just to keep
the universe existing?

That's...
so attractive.

It is?

Okay, look,
let's just do it once.

Sorry.

Aaah!

Happy now?He was suffering.

Keep moving.

We have to get
to the return threshold

before the ticking clock
on your suit gets to zero.

Why would you put
ticking clock --

Because if it's too easy
to get there,

we'll never get there.

If you don't want to be meta
stop, deconstructing shit.

That's
the thematic seal.

Gotta find a way
to disrupt it.

Okay, Morty, tell a story
unrelated to us.

Uh, what do --Stop thinking and do it!

Uh, okay, uh,
there was this --

My name is Mike Johnson.
That's good coffee.

Better get that door.

Iiiiiiii, hello.

I want your cookies.

I'm hungry,
I want your cookies.

Scorpions, scorpions.

There's scorpions outside.
Get inside.

What do they want
from us?

They want food.
Me too.

Okay, just stop.

I'm not
a writer, okay?

Relax, your story was supposed
to be awful and stupid.

I just failed to
predict how well

that would mesh
with the theme.

Think. Think.

What kind of story
would we never --

Morty, do you know
what the Bechdel Test is?

The what?For God's sake, Morty,

the formula for
measuring female agency

in a story proposed by
lesbian cartoonist Allison --

what the hell are they
teaching you in that school?!

Other stuff!Then you've killed us both!

Why is lesbian part
of her job title?!

Oh, now you're
progressive?!

What is the test?!You have to tell --

Morty, Morty.

Two women.
They both have to have names

and talk to each other
about something...

Rick!

...other than a man...Oh, Rick, listen to me.

Once upon a time,
my mom and my sister...

Listen to me!

Mom, can I try
your tea?

Yes, Summer.

Yes. Try my tea.

It's so good.
It's so warm.

Mom, can I talk to you

about my special time?

It's okay.
I have one, too.

Mine is heavy today.

Mine is never light.

I love you ever
since you were...

mailed to me.

By a doctor woman.

Your special time
is your power.

It makes you strong
like a boob.

Strong against what?

Scorpions.
Female Scorpions.

They're attacking
outside. Come on.

Fight them with your
heavy special time.

You do it, too.

Hello?
Hello?

I'm that Supreme Court lady,
and you fucking did it.

We did it!
We did it!

Great job, Morty.

A feminist masterpiece.

Hey, look.

Guess who's got two penises
and all the agency?

Rick and Morty.

Story Lord.

I should've known you were
behind this, and I did.

Who is this guy?
Ugh.

He's like a Matrix
Space Frasier.

Let's get this fight
over with, nerd.

I've got
shit to do.

You of all people
know, Rick,

there can be no destination
without a journey.

I don't know that at all.
I regularly teleport.

Oh, of course.
No rules for you.

Spiraling through
the multiverse,

burping semi-improvised dialogue
about how nothing matters,

so we may as well pull out
our dicks and rub them

on fate's glaring teeth
like we're brushing fate's teeth

but we're using your gross,
dirty dick.

Must be nice.

Nobody's stopping you.

True. Not anymore.

Goddamn!We already did this.

Oh, is this a double beat?
Oh, well.

Just how I adventure,
dawg.

This is more
impressive than

the Tickets Please Guy,
though.

You are like 90%
cum gutter.

It's called discipline.
Watch this.

God damn.
Geez!

Do we have to
fight him?

I don't want to.

We surrender.
We're not fighting.

Ow!

Ow!

Fucking kick your ass.

Ow!

Oh!

Hey! Get back in your egg!

- What the --
- Don't worry, Morty!

Nothing out there
is canon!

We've got a pulse.Stay with me, Private.

Smith, listen to me.
You were exposed

to a chemical that is
altering your mind.

To beat it,
you have to hold on --

We're losing him.

Aliens. Sarge?!

Morty, never forget the highest
truth of all --

you're getting your
ass kicked on a train.

Professor Sanchez?

Did it work?

I wouldn't say that,
Marcus.

I'd say it
fucking worked.

100% time dilation
and total immersion.

Define "total."
Marcus,

I've been back in reality
for three hours,

and I still have memories
of a completely different life.

I-I-I was
a scientist still.

I-I-I was --
I-I-I had developed

inter-dimensional travel,
I-I-I-I had a daughter.

I-I didn't
have a mustache.

I-I was kinda funny sometimes,
mostly burping.

No more secret testing.

I can help people now.

You've helped people.

I've hurt more.

Aaah!

P-P-Professor Sanchez.
I-I'm Morty Smith

from the -- the --
the the 241st.

They -- they -- put your
pill in our food.

It -- it works.Call the police!

It's okay. It's okay.
It's not real.

N-n-n-n-nothing's
real.

I'm sorry, son.

I-i-it's okay.
You aren't real.

God, you're right.
I should do more freeform stuff.

In you go.What's happening?

The reason
I brought you here.

I'll now fuel
my anthology with your

limitless potential,
propelling it to

its final stop --
beyond the fifth wall.

You idiot. Our potential
isn't limitless.

You'll never break
the fifth wall

before you've burnt
us out.

Is that so?
Oh, well. Win-win.

Rick,
w-what's he doing?

He's trying to tap
into us, Morty.

Resist.

I can't believe you're finally
headed off to college.

Yeah, you know,
it really felt like

you were gonna be
17 forever.

For, like,
16 years, at least.

I can't believe
I'm tearing up over this.

Jesus, Rick, you know,
you've really softened up.

It's a human moment,
Morty.

It's a human moment.

Aaah!
Aaah! It hurts!

Abradolph Lincoler?
I thought you were dead.

I'm very much alive,
and I need your help.

Yeah!

Shit. He's taking
the good stuff, Morty.

Wait, is --
is any of this canon?

It could have been.

Oh, dear.

Are there things Rick Sanchez
holds sacred after all?

How did you find us?

I trusted you!

Don't blame others
for your bad decisions.

Resist, Morty!
Resist before he burns us out!

Oh, too late now!

What's wrong, Rick?

Don't you want to see
how your story ends?!

Holy shit, Rick.
What do we --

There -- there --
there's now way out!

You're right, Morty.

Sometimes it does seem
like there's no way out.

Like it's hopeless.

But remember, there's always
someone there for us.

Who?

My best friend
and personal savior,

Jesus Christ.

What?! You -- you don't
believe in God.

But He believes
in us, Morty.

You know, I thought
Iwas the inventor,

but the greatest
invention of all

is the free gift
of Eternal Life.

Is this --
are you fucking with me?

Oh, trust me, Morty.

I've done plenty of
effed up stuff in my life.

But it's never too late
to accept Christ.

Jesus is always
knocking at the door.

All we have to do
is open it and let Him

into our hearts.
How?

I'm so glad you asked,
Morty.

Just close your eyes
and go to Him in prayer.

Like this.

Heavenly Father.Heavenly Father.

Thank you for sending
your only begotten son.

What a second, no!
What are you doing?!

Jesus, I accept you
into my heart.

No! This sucks.

Stop! You guys would
never do this.

Fill me with your Spirit.

Make me a shining city
on a hill for you.

- No! No!
- Make me born again.

- No!
- In Jesus' name, we pray.

- Amen.
- Amen.

- Amen!
- You did it!

Way to go, Morty!Crossy.

Bible-Saurus.
You made it.

We wouldn't miss this
for anything!

You said it,
Mr. Celery.

What the fuck
is all of this?!

Greatest story
ever told, Story Lord.

No, it's not.
It's awful!

I beg your pardon?

Ah!

Goddamn.

My Lord and my God!

- No! No! It sucks in here.
- Let's get the fuck

outta here. Go, now.

Ugh.
We're safe, Morty.

Nobody ever wanted
to see that shit.

Wh-what's gonna happen
to Story Lord?

He gets to spend eternity in
every writer's hell --

the Bible.
I don't know.

Some people actually
like that stuff.

Seems kind of cynical.

I just don't like taking
cheap shots, you know?

Cheap shots?
Morty, we were literally

saved by Jesus Christ.

Tell me in any way
how that's offensive.

This was
a little confusing,

but I guess it brought us
closer together, you know?

Tested our demons.

Made us believe in
ourselves more than ever.

Yeah.
You're right, Morty.

We got all that meta-canon
shit outta the way

and now we can
just be ourselves.

Now what do you say we
bring thistrain

into the station.

Oh, shit.

So what do you think?

Wow. Where did you
get this thing?

The Citadel of Ricks
Gift Shop.

Do you really like it?
I didn't think you'd even care.

What? Morty. No.
I love it.

You did the most
important thing.

You -- you bought
something.

What?You bought something.

With money. God.
I love money so much, Morty.

Are you being sarcastic?Merchandise, Morty.

Your only purpose in life is to
buy and consume merchandise.

And you did it.
You went into a store --

an actual honest to God store --
and you bought something.

You didn't ask questions
or raise ethical complaints.

You -- you just looked straight
into the bleeding jaws

of capitalism
and said "Yes, daddy, please."

And I'm...
I'm so proud of you.

I only wish you could've
bought more.

I -- I love buying things
so much, Morty.

Rick, are -- are you --

do you need to go
to the hospital?

I love you, Morty.
Give Grandpa a kiss.

Give -- give -- gimme --
give Grandpa a kiss.

Lips if you want.

What-- whatever
you're comfortable with.

Some cultures do that.

That was sweet.
Thank you.

I -- I love you.
You're my little buddy.

Okay.

Let's watch some
Interdimensional Cable.

So you're saying
my father

and His kingdom...

Well, yes --
it's based on the fusion

of a Sumerian god
named "Ya"

and a Mesopotamian god
named "Way."

And we're in
a toy train?

Yes.

It's enough to really
make you question

all of existence,
isn't it?

So what do you think you're
gonna do about it?

I'm gonna do
what I've always done.

I'm gonna get the fuck
outta here.

Father of omens!
Give me blood beyond sight!

Hey, what
the fuck, Morty?

The train you got me just
completely derailed itself.

There's blood all over
the windows on it.

Oh, man, I'm sorry, Rick.
I guess I'll return it.

Return --
Are you insane?

Did you hear
nothing I said?

Buy another one,
Morty.

Consume, Morty.

Nobody's out there shopping
with this fucking virus.

Where's your
fucking wallet?!

Tired of the same boring adventures

with your dogshit Morty?

Yeah!
Aw. Geez.

Then get ready for the Citadel
of Rick's Story Train.

Story Train.
Story Train.

The Citadel of Rick's Story Train

comes with car after car
of enemies, lovers,

and Goomby, all grappling with

the nature of who
you truly are.

Rick is a god!
Tickets Please.

Whoa! Watch out!
It's Story Lord!

Damn. He's jacked.

Pure cum gutter.

And of course,
what story would be complete

without the engineer of
the Greatest Story Ever Told.

Oh, Jesus Christ.

I have come not to judge

the world, but to save it.

And the best part is,
the fun never ends.

Thanks to the Rick-patented
anthology generator,

you'll never run out
of new stories

and people to tell them.

Are they alive? Of course.

But not in any ways
that matter.

They. Have. No. Souls.

Puppets. Of. Fate.

The Story Train.

Available now in
The Citadel of Ricks.

Buy it ironically.
Buy it sincerely. Just buy it.

Not buying it is an act
of buying it.

Buy it now. Look it up.
It's real.

www.story-train.com.

On the Internet. It's there.
Buy it. Buy the train.

We want you to buy the train.

Get us out of here.
I'll hold them off.

My name is Beth Smith.

Tell your top bugs
the Defiance lives on.

I will.
I will.

I'll make you a legend.
Blade Smith.

Beth Smith.Beth. Beth. Beth Smith.

Okay, God,
it's just such a plain --

I'm trying to come up
with a mnemonic device.

You could connect it
to not dying.

I know, I know! You think that
would sear it right in,

but it just speaks
to the sheer forgettability.

Oh, God.
I-I-I'm, uh, so sorry.

Uh, uh, oh, God.

Starts with a "B" --

Congratulations to your
government, business,

or terror cell on its
acquisition of

the NX-5 Planet Remover
by Xamaxax

in partnership with
Wrangler jeans.

The NX-5's industry-leading

tachyon beams eliminate planets
twice as fast as the NX-4S

with half the battery and zero
built-in fatal design flaws.

That's right.
No more secret hole

that blows the whole thing up
when you shoot it.

Your enemies will say
it's unfair.

We say it's about time.
- Damn it.

We risked our lives for that?

You did your best.
Maybe you need a break.

Don't you ever miss Earth?I don't have to miss it.

I'm technically still there.

My dad made a perfect clone
of me to take my place.

Boy, that Rick.

So, if you do go back,

what happens to the clone?

Does it have, like,
a proximity-triggered device

in its neck?Who cares? Are we done?

Sure.
Unless you want me to remove

the proximity-triggered device
from your neck.

Think it's a bomb?

Man, what if this is
how you found out

he never wanted you back,

that he loved the clone
more than you?

How crazy would that be?

Crazy and of --
of course soul-crushing.

For you. I actually have
something for that.

Y-You want some?
They're nonaddictive.

That's not true.
They're totally addictive.

I'm a terrible doctor.

I actually have something
for that, too.

You want some?
Nonaddictive. Mmm.

I'm a great doctor.

Dr. Wong had
a cancellation today.

Anybody up for
a family session?

- I could do that.
- I'm -- I'm down to clown.

Ooh, not sure my therapy puppet
will be done in time.

Great, because she
specifically asked you

to stop bringing puppets.
Dad?

I love therapy, family therapy
most of all,

but I am actually
disintegrating.

Oh, my God!Whoa! Dad!

Is that really it?
We did it?

It's the invisibility belt.

Whoa-whoa-whoa!
He grazed them.

That's gonna hurt
in like 10 seconds.

Thanks, Morty.Why should I let you use it?

You never let me use it.Can I have the belt?

It would really piss off Morty.Fantastic idea.

What the hell?!
You jerk! Give it!

Hey! Ow!

Share the invisibility.
Jerry?

Ooh, this looks like a job
for Mr. Nibbles.

Let me just glue
one more eye on.

I'm gonna kill you!

Woof.
Looks like you two have to fight

about why you can't
control your kids.

Good thing Dr. Wong's
got an opening.

Bye.
- You're a bad father.

Don't let him divide us.

Garage, family therapy mode.

Ah.

Honey, you're back.

You seem surprised.You never wrote.

And never exploded?

What I'm hearing is that
you think that's a bomb.

So does every engineer
that's seen it.

Engineer?
Princess, I'm sure every caveman

that sees a microwave calls
it a rock cabinet.

The point of inventing is
to make things that don't exist.

Then whip me up a reason
not to kill you.

Dad?
We're off to Dr. Wong's.

Scan her.

Dad?

Okay, have fun, pumpkin.

Sorry I'm a piece-of-shit
father.

Oh, ha-ha! Well, the
self-loathing buys a lot back.

Jerry, leave the puppet.

It's a one-way ticket
to a breakthrough, Beth.

The device in her neck
wouldhave transferred

a database of her memories
to your device

before vaporizing her.

So much for that plan.

Why is she -- it --

why am I back with Jerry?

I thought she was a copy of me.

She is a copy of you.

If she ran back to that
dingleberry,

that's on you.

Want to grab a drink?All the time.

Good girl.

Ooh.

- To catch a predator.
- What the hell?!

Thermal goggles, bitch.

Mom said share.

You can't share invisibility.
Take those off.

No.

So I'll just see you
at cheerleader practice?

Should I bring a poncho?

Alright!
State your terms.

Give back the belt.
You take the goggles.

Go away.
We trade in an hour.

Deal.

How do you like that, bitch?

I liked it more
than my old belt.

"Tiny Big Man Junior"?

You shoulda shared.

What are you doing
in my house?

Did I wander that far
from my console?

They should put a warning
on these things.

So, we overrode the gates,

and the slave rebellion
took the capital.

Pretty cool.Very cool.

My daughter,
having space adventures.

They are skewing a tad
"Star Wars"-y, though.

Don't forget to have fun.

Well, I came back to murder you,
not get your notes,

but I'll remember to fart more
while I'm saving the galaxy.

Okay, I'm the one
that made this possible.

- It's not a competition.
- Of course not.

Just curious, though,
if it were,

would "most wanted"
be first place?

You're fighting
the Gromflomites?

Dad, they're trying
to take over the galaxy!

Everybody in the galaxy
tries to take over the galaxy.

The trick is to be left alone
by whoever succeeds.

Eh, it's your hero phase.

I had one, too.
You'll outgrow it.

No, you did.

I'm not gonna outgrow
giving a shit.

Sources tell us these aliens,
who call themselves

the Neeeew Galactic Federation,
will blow up the planet

unless some woman with a very
boring name gives herself up.

Oh, come on. Way to give a shit.

Next time, don't wipe it
on your home planet.

Oh, shit.
They're gonna track down Beth.

You mean...
Beth's clone.

Right.
Beth's clone.

What -- What did I say?

It really was nice
seeing you again.

Whoo! Yeah!
Go, Honey Bees!

Good practice, girls.

And remember,
we are in a drought,

so be sure to shower
as one big group

at the exact same time.

Shower fire!
The shower's on fire!

Step aside, girls!
I got this!

You're a monster!

Still wanna share?

Morty Smith, hands up.

You are under arrest
for crimes against

the New Improved
Galactic Federation.

Wait. What?
How are you doing that?

You're not a psychic,
are you?

Do you have psychic powers?

- Uh, yes.
- Are they strong powers?

We're just looking
for your mother.

You can't, like,
stop our hearts, can you?

- Uh, I can.
- Okay, we surrender.

Jerry, do you agree
that the use of puppets

makes you seem
dumb and crazy?

I don't think "crazy" is
a responsible word to use in --

It is now.
This is crazy.

You're being crazy.

They do it in therapy on TV.

Well, TV gives British people
prizes for baking, Jerry.

Tonya?Tammy? Tammya? Tammya.

Hi, Mrs. Smith.

I like your hair
better this way.

How's the stomach?What?

Hey!
I only said "hey."

It's not like I can do more
than that.

As much as I'd like to kill you,

my superiors have some questions
about the Defiance.

I don't have a --
I have a Defiance?

Oh, God, I'm a clone.

That's your defense?

No, my defense is eat me.

Hey! Ah!
We've been over this.

All I do is say "hey."

Smart guns,
white-list human life.

And the therapist.

Tammy, this is the office
where my family works

to better itself.What, and that makes it sacred?

No, it makes it a place
I've rigged with a lot

of voice-activated
escape contingencies.

These are all good points.

I need to take a long
look at myself.

Aah!
Aah!

I'd like to discuss that.

I don't discuss problems,

I incinerate them.

Everybody in the car.

Everybody in my family,
not the world.

Jesus, Wong.
Boundaries.

I'm better than this job.

Can't you just make a portal?

Your children are down
there invisible, Jerry.

"Make a portal"?
Father of the year back here.

Well, you're one to talk.

You told me I wasn't a clone.

Y-You're not a clone.

And who is that?Uh, uh, a clone.

Why would you make a clone of me

just to send the clone
into space?

Well, you didn't want to go,
and I thought,

"Okay, that's cool."

But then I thought, "Well,
you know what would be even

cooler is a space daughter,"
s-so I made one.

And I put a bomb in her neck
in case she ever came back.

Father of the year.

She wasn't supposed
to come back.

Why did she?

Well, she found a bomb
in her neck.

Wouldn't you?

Father of the year.Shut up!

I'm tired of
believing you.

I want to talk to her.
- No, you don't.

Jerry, do something.

Hey.

He told me you're the clone.

What do you think
he told me?

- You're the clone?
- Wow, naive and attractive.

Wow, jaded and hot.

I know this is bad parenting,

but if you stop fighting,
you both get McDonald's.

How about I just blow my brains
out, starting with hers?

Okay, Wendy's.
We love Wendy's.

I-I think they even
gave us some money.

- Drop it. Don't move!
- Freeze! Get down!

On the ground! On the ground!
Don't move!

Everybody, shut up! You're all
saying different shit.

Wait, so there
are two of them?

More importantly,
which one is mine?

Uh, neither, chauvinist.

Whatever.
Take them both.

Cool beam.
But let's bargain.

I'm the one you really want.

Excuse me?

Uh, smartest man
in the universe?

Secret to
interdimensional travel?

Ask your bosses.

My bosses are bugs, Rick.

You killed the old ones.
The new ones are half my age.

They know if you're left alone,
you're a non-threat.

Oofa!We got the payload.

Fire up the NX-5.

Earth's going ta-ta.

You might want to do that thing

where you find a new universe

where you can suck
yourself off.

You can't tell me what to do.

Awesome. He resisted.
We can shoot him.

Wha?Just go with it, Jerry.

Everybody, drop your guns --
except for Jerry!

Fucking classic.

Holy shit, Morty.And Summer.

W-We worked together.
That's -- that's our arc.

We went from siblings to
invisible to working together.

It's not "Citizen Kane,"
but why compete

with whatever's going on here,
you know?

Unh!

Aah!

You made me go to a wedding.

And you killed my best friend.
I shoulda said that one first.

Congratulations, Earth,
on being destroyed by the NX-5,

brought to you by Wrangler.

Ugh, guess the galaxy's
most-wanted mammal

needs her daddy
to come change her diapie.

Come on, kids,
we have to go do

a fucking piece of shit
"Star Wars."

Attention, Zeta 99-2.

We know you have a stolen ship.
Stand down.

Oh, am I not a non-threat now?

Hey, you are not cleared
to land.

We will open fire.Hold your ground, men.

You'll be heroes.

Summer, try unlocking
that door by scanning

your high-school
friend's dead face.

Uh, I have --
I have to pee.

Pee on the floor.
It's a Death Star.

Okay, but there's rebellion
and then there's --

Here, Dad.Perfect.

What am I doing wrong?

Ugh, her eyes are closed.
Morty, open the left one.

I've got the right.

She died the way she lived,
overserialized.

I'm gonna rescue your mom
and her clone

without revealing
which is which.

You two find the NX-and shut it down.

I mean, don't die trying.
There's infinite Earths.

If you can save this one,
it's gravy.

Dream team rides again!

Oh, yeah, we're like
Luke and Leia.

Uh, except no kissing part.

What's another famous
brother-sister team?

Uh, Hansel and Gretel?

Yeah, right,
those two were fucking.

Dad, we need the belt.

I can't go with you guys
watching.

You're invisible.What if the pee isn't?

You know what?
We don't need invisibility.

Working together is our belt.

That's our arc.
Let's do it.

I'm gonna go ahead and whistle.

That's how good I feel.

Oh, God.
I knew it.

Ugh, this floor isn't level.

Are they gonna torture us?

Unless you plan on
telling them what I know.

Last chance to guess
who was the clone.

You're his daughter.

Just something about the eyes,

the shameless abandonment
of your family.

However can I live with myself?

One theory -- I was designed by
your father to live with myself,

which would mean you made
a conscious choice

to swallow your dreams with
cheap wine and dinosaur pasta.

You know that's the kind
Jerry likes,

same way I know the only
Goddamn dream you'll ever follow

is your shitty
father's approval.

You fetch your shitty
father's lemonade.

You cosplay as your
shitty father in his 30s.

Red alert. Red alert.

Rick Sanchez --

More like dead alert.
What else? What else?

I wrote some stuff down
in my Notes app.

Let me just find it.

Screw it. Beth, if -- if one of
you is still alive,

you're my real daughter.

If you're both alive,
don't hurt the other one.

She's just a clone.
She's not worth it.

I'm coming, baby.

That piece of shit.That piece of shit.

I came back kill him,
you know.

I'd like to help.

Kick me between my eyes.From here?

Oh, you dropped yoga
so you could buy

Jerry more Flintstones
Vitam--

Oh, I do not like the looks
of this giant fight chamber.

Bird Person?It is now Phoenix Person.

You're working for them?

What did they do to you, BP?

It is now PP.
Where is Tammy?

Oh, don't worry about her.
I killed her.

I loved her.Really? Huh.

Then can I suggest,
as an alternate name,

Crazy Pussy
Whipped Person?

Aah!

Unh!

Aah!

It's funny. I always wondered
who would win if we ever fought.

Then you were always
a bad friend.

Aah!

Morty, we had one grenade.

He had a gun.Whatever.

Come on.

Did you hear something?Doesn't matter.

If anyone's around, they're here
to stop the laser,

and they can't do it
without us seeing them.

"Working together is our belt"?

You gave it away!You said we didn't need it.

I wish you were never born.

You were an accident.

How come some of
the pants are --

The NX-5 can't destroy
Wrangler jeans.

Like, it literally can't destroy
them or it's programmed not to?

Gee, what do you think?

You kill a good bug,
for a horse doctor.

Thanks, me.

Maybe we could do, like,
a "Parent Trap" thing

together sometime.

As long as you mean
the Lindsay Lohan version.

Naturally.

What do you think they do
with all those jeans?

Make them into jackets?It's not about conserving denim.

It's marketing.
Like, uh,

"The NX-5 destroys
the whole planet

except for
the Wrangler jeans."

Because they're so tough.
Tougher than the laser?

Stupid.You're talking about it.

Mm, you're right.
They -- they got me.

Hey, over here.
Look at me.

Did you just see a pantsless
little boy run by?

I'm not falling
for that again.

I used to be invisible,
but now I'm the opposite.

Get him.
But not in a weird way.

You made it weird.

NX-5 corporate sponsor
detected.

Cannot penetrate Wranglers.

Built too tough.

Built... too... tough.

I killed them!
I-I did -- I did it offscreen.

God damn it.
Morty, fix your underwear.

I saw your balls for a second.

That's on you.

Why can't I meet
your parents?

Are you
embarrassed of me?

No, of them.

Aww.

Unh -- ahh!

Never thought this was
how I'd die.

We're nowhere near Venice,

and you're not a dwarf
in a raincoat.

Step back.
You're not killing him

till we kick his ass,
Bird Person.

My name is Phoenix Person.

No one's calling you that.
Dumb.

It fascinates me that
an entire family

can be this critical
and suck this much.

Aah!

Bird Person, stop.

It's me, that Tammy girl.

Tammy, this is unexpected.

I was told you were dead.

That is ab-so-lute-ly not true.

I'm more alive than
I've ever been.

You are behaving
rather strangely.

Me? Strange?
Oh, my.

Well, who's normal, really?

Now, come here, you big
hollow-boned featherhead.

Let me give you
some of this sweet ass.

Saved the day with puppeting.

Only one with a decent arc.

He does have
his moments.

Mom, Dad!

Mom.
Uh, we did it!

Morty became
super visible!

Summer put my jeans in a laser!

Morty, look
at your little balls!

I know!Bring it in here, guys.

Damn, this thing has
twin turbines?

I'll forgive you for abandoning
us if you let me drive it.

That works for me --
I was just gonna give you

space cigarettes.I love having two moms.

And I love having two wives.

Never gonna happen, Jerry.

You jerk-offs ready to get
the answers

to your burning questions?

What's this, Dad?The memory of which Beth is real

and which Beth is a clone,
obviously.

You mind-blew yourself?
You --

You literally don't even know
which of your daughters is real.

Of course you don't.
Why am I surprised?

I'm sure you'd love for us
to need that from you,

but I don't care
what's in that vial.

Yeah, me neither.

You're a piece of shit
either way.

After all this, you don't want
to know the truth?

The truth is we have more
important shit to do

like raise our kids
and stamp out the Federation,

neither of which seem like they
want anything to do with you.

Morty? Sum-Sum? You gotta at
least wanna know

who your real mom is.

Not really, Rick.

We have two badass moms now.

It's --
That's kind of a win/win.

Yeah, Grandpa Rick, don't drag
us into your bullshit

just because
you're losing control.

I know what I want to do.

I want you to decide.What?

For once in my life,
I want you to decide, Dad.

Do you want me to stay here
and be part of your life,

or do you want me to leave?

﻿[ DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYS]

Cynthia...

JERRY:
Oh, my god. No. No.

- I told you.
- Hold on.

Will you please...

not marry me?
I chose Veronica.

- What?!
- Yes!

- Hold it.
- Why would he chose Veronica?

Because he loves her?

Well, if it's any
consolation, Summer,

none of it mattered
and the entire show was stupid.

Okay, I've got an idea, Rick.

You show us your concept
of good TV,

and we'll crap all over that.

Thought you'd never ask.

Hey.

Oh, cool. ls that
crystallized xanthanite?

It conducts electrons
across dimensions.

20% accurate as usual, Morty.

The important thing being,

I just upgraded
our cable package

with programing from every
conceivable reality.

Wait. Does that mean
we get Showtime Extreme?

How about Showtime Extreme
in a world

where man evolved from corn?

We're not so different.
We're both corn of action.

Yeah, but one of us
is dead corn!

SUMMER:
Boring.

Summer [BURPS] you just
spent [BURPS] three months

watching a man
choose a fake wife.

So, what, it'd be better
if the people were corn?

RICK:
Jerry, you don't get it.

This is infinite TV
from infinite universes.

Look.
- This shit is delicious.

A movie about a guy eating shit.

A violent antique show.

[ LAUGHS]
It's a pleasure to have you.

The pleasure's all mine.

Letterman from a timeline
where Jerry's famous.

- JERRY: Wait!
- BETH: What in the hell?

RICK:
I agree. Where is this going?

No, the other thing!
Go back.

RICK:
Really? All right, fine.

Glen, this court order says
you can't eat shit anymore.

[ DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYS]
- All right, Jerry.

When you're right, you're right.

Now I'm hooked.

Coming up next on
"Shmloo's the Shmloss,"

Shmlony has a nightmare.

- Shmlantha! Shmlona!
- RICK: Amazing... a dimension

where all proper nouns
begin with "Shmla."

Shmla... Shmlangela?

Shmlonathan?

All right, that actually
got old pretty quick.

[ GROANS ] Rick!

Will you please go back
to me on "David Letterman"?

Infinity's a big number, Jerry.

I don't remember the channel.

SUMMER:
Ah! Go back! Go back!

- RICK: Geez.
- You speak the true-true.

Oh, my god.
Dad's in "Cloud Atlas"!

I'm in "Cloud Atlas"!
What's "Cloud Atlas"?

Sometimes,
small true-true

different than
the big true-true.

How is this possible?

Infinite timelines,
infinite possibilities,

including a timeline
where Jerry's a movie star.

Look, you guys are
getting excited

about the wrong aspect
of this device.

Wha... look at this.

And now, another quick mystery.

I just want to know who
could have done this.

It's a travesty.
- I did.

See this knife
and all the blood on it?

Here's my fingerprints.

Guilty. I sentence you
to life in prison.

Here's another quick mystery.

- My mother's dead.
- And I killed her.

Here's the weapon, and cuff me.

Thank you very much.

Guilty.
Sentenced to murder.

[ CHOKES, GAGS]

- Here's another.
- I'm the killer.

Oh, wow, that one was
really quick, wasn't it?

Now, who wants to watch
random, crazy TV shows

from different dimensions,
and... and then who wants

to narcissistically obsess
about their alternate selves?

I want to obsess about myself.

[ SIGHS ] Here, these scan
your retinas

and let you view
parallel timelines

through genetically matching
versions of your eyes.

Go fetch.

- This is so cool.
- Ladies first.

I'm proud of you, Morty.

Hey, man, I don't give
a crap about myself, Rick.

Let's watch some
crazy stuff, yo.

I'm Ants in My Eyes Johnson,

here at Ants in My Eyes
Johnson's electronics.

I mean, there's so many ants
in my eyes.

And there's so many TVs,
microwaves, radios, I think.

I can't... I'm not 100% sure
what we have here in stock

because I can't see anything.

Our prices, I hope,
aren't too low.

Check out this refrigerator,
only $200.

What about this microwave?
Only $100.

That's fair.

I'm Ants in My Eyes Johnson.
Everything's black.

I can't see a thing.

And also, I can't feel
anything, either.

Did I mention that?

But that's not as catchy as
having ants in your eyes,

so that always goes, you know,
off by the wayside.

I can't feel.
It's a very rare disease.

All my... all my nerves,

they don't allow
for the sensation of touch,

so I never know what's going on.

Am I standing, sitting?
I don't know.

Are we sure we wanna look
at our own alternate lives?

You're right. Maybe we should
just play Yahtzee.

Give me those.
[ BEEPING ]

BETH:
What do you see?

Whiteness...
pure whiteness.

[ SNORTING ]

You're my best friend,
Jerry Smith.

I love doing cocaine with you.

Whoa, I love doing cocaine
with you, too, Johnny Depp.

[ GROANS ] Haven't we spent
enough time on you?

[ BEEPING ]
I'm performing surgery...

but not on a horse...
on a human.

JERRY:
That's great, Beth.

You always wanted to be
a real surgeon.

I am a real surgeon.

Uh... Summer's turn.

Finally.
[ BEEPING ]

I don't see anything.

Well, you should select
a different timeline.

I mean, if your father and I
achieved our dreams,

there's a chance
you weren't even born.

That came out wrong.
That came out very wrong.

Fine. I'll find a world where
you bothered to have me.

[ BEEPING ]

We're playing Yahtzee.

Yahtzee's fun.
We love Yahtzee.

It's a fun game
for fun families.

Hey, could I get those goggles
back for a second?

It's a 45-horsepower
with antilock brakes,

and it's the official car
of "Mr. Sneezy 3D."

It's the brand-new Sneezy XL.

The horn, when you honk it,
makes a sneeze noise.

[ SNEEZES]

It's polite, it's right,

and it's Sneezy, Deezy
MC... Deluxe.

I'm Mr. Sneezy.
[ SNEEZES]

Huh, seems like TV
from other dimensions

has a somewhat looser
feel to it.

Yeah, it's got an almost
improvisational tone.

It's in theaters now.
Coming this Summer.

Two brothers in a van,

and then a meteor hits.

And they ran as fast
as they could

from giant cat monsters.

And then a giant tornado came.

And that's when things got
knocked into 12th gear.

A Mexican armada shows up,

with weapons made
from t-tomatoes.

And you better
bet your bottom dollar

that these two brothers
know how to handle business

in "Alien Invasion
Tomato Monster

Mexican Armada Brothers,

Who are Just Regular Brothers,

Running in a Van
from an Asteroid

and All Sort of
Things: The Movie."

Hold on. There's more.

Old women are coming,
and they're also in the movie.

And they're gonna come

and cross attack
these two brothers.

But let's get back
to the brothers,

because they're...
they have a strong bond.

You don't want to know
about it here,

but I'll tell you one thing.

The moon... it comes crashing
into Earth.

And what do you do then?

It's two brothers and...
and they're gonna...

It's called "Two Brothers."
"Two Brothers."

[ LAUGHING ] It's just called
"Two Brothers."

Holy crap.
I am winning a Nobel prize.

Come on. Time's up.
[ BEEPING ]

I'm taming a lion.

No, wait.
There are film cameras.

I might be a lion tamer
in a movie.

You get the idea.
I work with lions.

[ BEEPING ]

Ohh, we're not playing Yahtzee!

We're playing
Chutes and Ladders.

Seems like when I exist,
life gets a little more...

I don't know... predictable?

When two people create
a life together,

they set aside their previous
lives as individuals.

Give me a break.

We're not heroes for having
unprotected sex on prom night.

Oh, I get it.

Now that you know
you could have had it better,

you resent me
for holding you back.

Well, now that we know you think
the tables are turning,

we know you thought
there were unturned tables.

What are you talking about?

All this time, you've been
thinking, "what if that loser,

Jerry, hadn't talked me out
of the abortion?"

- Um...
- Well, now you know.

You'd be a doctor.
Whoop-DE-do.

You'd also be drinking wine
alone

in a house full of exotic birds.

And I'd be on DiCaprio's yacht,
banging Kristen Stewart.

You thought about
getting an abortion?

Everyone thinks about it.

Obviously, I'm the version of me
that didn't do it,

so you're welcome.
- Yeah, you're welcome.

Yeah, thank you guys so much.

It's a real treat to be
raised by parents

that forced themselves
to be together

instead of being happy.

Hey, do we have any
wafer cookies?

Mmm!

Oh, boy.

Looks like you guys have been
checking out alternate lives

and realizing you don't
have it as good, huh?

That's too bad.

You know, me and Morty
are having a blast.

We just discovered a show
called "Ball Fondlers."

I mean, I don't want to rub it
in or anything,

but you guys clearly backed
the wrong conceptual horse.

[ METAL MUSIC PLAYS]

- I'm in heaven right now.
- The best day of my life.

So, now what do we do?

That show "Ball Fondlers"
sounded kind of interesting.

- Dad!
- What?!

They're having fun in there.
What do you guys want from me?

Every family on this block
has to wonder

if they're together by choice.

Our family just has
interdimensional goggles

to show us for a fact
that we're not.

- Well, I'm leaving.
- You can't leave. You're 17.

Yeah, and I'm not pregnant.

I'm gonna have better judgment
than you guys had at my age.

I'm gonna move
to the southwest and...

I don't know, do something
with turquoise.

It's "Saturday Night Live,"

starring a piece of toast,

two guys with handlebar
mustaches,

a man painted silver
who makes robot noises,

Gar Ma Nar Nar,

three, um, um, um...

I'll get back to that one,

a hole in the wall

where the men can see it all,

and, returning for his
25th consecutive year,

Bobby Moynihan!

Interesting fun fact...

Moynihan and a piece of toast
hate each other.

Apparently, they've got some
real creative differences.

Hey, are you tired of real doors

cluttering up your house,

where you open them and you
actually go somewhere,

and you go into another room?

Get on down
to Real Fake Doors. That's us.

Fill a whole room up with them.

See, watch.
Check this out.

[ GRUNTS ] Won't open.

[ GRUNTS ] Won't open.

[ GRUNTS ] Not this one.

[ GRUNTS ] Not this one.

None of them open.

Fakedoors.com is our website,

so check it out for a lot of
really great deals

on fake do-o-o-o-rs!

Hey, wait a minute, Rick.

I thought this was a commercial.

What's going on?
- Relax, Morty.

Don't... don't worry about it.
Let's just see where this goes.

Step on it!
We all got places to be!

[ HONKS HORN ] Son of a bitch.

Oh, that must be where he lives.

Okay.

RICK:
Huh. He's making himself a sandwich now.

Hey, everybody.
So, this is my house.

Just made a sandwich...
peanut butter and jelly.

Still here, still selling
fake doors.

MORTY:
What?

Oh, my god.
It's still the commercial.

We have fake doors
like you wouldn't believe.

What are you worried about?
Come get fake doors.

Call us up and order
some fake doors today.

Don't even hesitate,
don't even worry,

and don't even...

All right, I'm bored.
Change it.

Wait, wait, Rick.
Hold on, hold on.

That's our slogan.

See it on the bottom
of the screen below our name.

Here's another slogan
right below that one.

What are you worried about?
Come get fake doors.

Get in here quick, get out quicker

with an arm of fake doors in your arms.

Okay, okay, you can change it.

[ YAWNS]
I hate Mamumanums-days,

and I really could go
for some enchiladas.

MORTY:
Hey, Rick, that's pretty cool.

It's just like Garfield, only
instead it's Gazorpazorpfield.

Hey, isn't Gazorpazorp where
those sex robots came from?

Remember that whole thing?

Yeah. Hey, that's a pretty...
pretty...

That's true.
That's right.

Yeah. Let's watch some more
Gazorpazorpfield.

Hey, John.
It's me, Gazorpazorpfield.

Boy fuck you, John,

you fuckin' dumb, stupid idiot.

Come on, Gazorpazorpfield.
Go easy on me, huh?

You dumb, stupid, weak,

pathetic, white, white,

uh... guilt...

white-guilt milquetoast

piece of human garbage.

Geez, Gazorpazorpfield,
that's...

you know, you're
pretty mean to me,

but that takes the cake.

I don't give a fuck.

I'm Gazorpazorp-fuckin'-field, bitch.

Now give me my
fucking enchiladas.

Hey, Rick, you know, did they
use Bill Murray for this?

Sounds a lot like Bill Murray.

No, Morty, it's Lorenzo Music.

In this reality,
he's still alive.

Oh, okay.
Was his name "Lorenzo Music"?

Yeah, I'm pretty sure.

He also did the voice of that
one guy from "Ghostbusters,"

which is really strange
because it's the same character

Bill Murray played in the movie.

But then, when they
made the movie,

Bill Murray did the voice
of Gazorpazorp...

- or Garfield, I mean.
- That's pretty cool, Rick.

So all that happened
in this reality, too?

I don't know.

Just making conversation
with you, Morty.

What, you think
I'm a... I'm...

I know everything about
everything?

Did you really talk me
out of the abortion?

Well, we... we blew a tire
on the way to the clinic.

I think, in my head, I was
doing it all for the kids.

And now the first kid is going
to do something with turquoise.

[ SIGHS ] Which is either
code for crystal meth

or a gateway to it.

So we didn't do
the kids any favors.

So we should stay together
for each other and ourselves,

or...

Or...

Man, woman, and now Trunkman?

We know science has created
men that have a trunk

that allows them
to have sex with both

male and female partners.

But we don't like the idea of
these people getting married.

Put a line in the sand,
everybody.

Vote "no" on proposition XW2.

The act that says trunkpeople
can get married.

Who needs it?

Not on my watch.

Paid for by Michael Denny
and The Denny Singers.

Hi. I'm a trunkperson,
and I want...

I feel love in my heart, too,
just like you.

I wanna be able
to express that love

with both a man and a woman.

And I won't be able to

if Denny and The Denny Singers
get their way.

Hey, let the trunkpeople have
sex and get married, huh?

Paid for by trunkpeople.

Oh, I love me
strawberry sniggles.

Ooh, I hope nobody ever gets
my hands on me

and tries to steal
my strawberry smiggles.

I'm gonna eat every last
one of them,

because... and then
they'll be in my stomach,

and nobody will ever be
able to eat them.

Except for me, because they'll
be all inside my stomach.

Um, my name is
Mr. Tophat Jones,

and God forbid anyone ever
take my sner...

little-people snibbles.

I'm keeping them all for me.

Mmm. Mmm.

Last bite.
Mmm.

Oh, now they're all resting
comfortably in my stomach.

Ooh, am I feeling good.

No! Get away from me!
Get away from me!

There's no more strawberry
snibbles... no!

[ CHOKES, SPUTTERS]

Jesus Christ!

Jesus Christ! It hurts!

My entrails are out!

Why would you even want
to eat these?

They're soaked
with my stomach acid.

Oh, Jesus Christ, lord, savior,

and spirit, save me.

Take me to the light.

Oh, my god. I see demons.

I see demons are coming!

Geez, Rick.
Oh, my god.

That's some pretty
hard-core stuff,

you know, for a cereal
commercial.

Well, Morty... I mean, you
wanna sell boxes of cereal,

you gotta pump the gas a little.

Pedal to the metal, Morty.

In a world where muscular
Mannies are coming,

and they're coming strong,

there's only three
unmuscular Michaels.

Get down. Hurry. Run.

[ SCREECHING]

And that's when real
Turbulent Juice is coming,

and you got to take care of it.

With Turbulent Juice,
turbulent tables,

no room is safe
from the turbulent power

of Turbulent Juice.

- What in the hell?
- Sex sells, Morty.

Sex sells what?

Was that a movie or, like,
does it clean stuff?

- [ SIGHS ]
- Hey, Dad.

- God.
- What's going on?

Well, your mother and I
are gonna be spending

some time apart, Morty.

And your sister found out
she was an unwanted pregnancy.

- What?
- Speaking of [BURPS] what,

Morty, [BURPS]
what should we watch next?

What about this?

Babylegs, you're a good
detective.

But not good enough,
because of your baby legs.

So I'm partnering you up
with Regularlegs.

Hey, there.

Detective, I'm...
this is upsetting to me

because I feel like I don't
need no regular-leg partner.

Babylegs, don't talk back to me.

Good luck, you two.

There's a criminal to kill.
[ SLURPS]

Wow, you sure found
this guy quick.

Uh, yeah, because I'm a good
detective.

Look, Babylegs.
It's the criminal.

Oh, fuck it. I'm the killer.
I'm running.

I'm running real quick.

Babylegs, here we go!

[TRILLING ]

That's the sound I make
when I'm trying to run fast.

[TRILLING ]

All right, I'm not
gonna get him.

I just learned a real
valuable lesson.

I'm coming, Babylegs.

I'm... Regularlegs.

[ GRUNTS ] We got him.

Hey, that was good teamwork.

Babylegs and Regularlegs,

I'm proud of you two
for working together.

And, Babylegs, I know
it was hard for you

to come to the conclusion
that you need a partner,

but I'm proud of you
that you did it.

Hey, thanks, Chief.

Now get the fuck out of here.

Pretty cool, huh, Morty?

Oh.
- I thought it was cool.

I don't give a fuck what
you think, Jerry.

[ CLICK ]

Hey, uh, y-you doing okay?

I kind of know how you feel,
Summer.

No, you don't.
You're the little brother.

You're not the cause of your
parents misery.

You're just a symptom of it.

- Can I show you something?
- Morty, no offense...

but a drawing of me you made
when you were eight

isn't gonna make me feel like
less of an accident.

That out there?
That's my grave.

- Wait, what?
- On one of our adventures...

Rick and I basically
destroyed the whole world,

so we bailed on that reality,
and we came to this one.

Because in this one,
the world wasn't destroyed.

And in this one, we were dead.

So we came here and...
and we buried ourselves,

and we took their place.

And every morning, Summer,
I eat breakfast

20 yards away
from my own rotting corpse.

So you're not my brother?

I'm better than your brother.

I'm a version of your brother
you can trust

when he says "don't run."

Nobody exists on purpose.
Nobody belongs anywhere.

Everybody's gonna die.

Come watch TV.

Mrs. Sullivan always planned

to leave everything to her cats.

But sometimes, plans need
a helping paw.

[THUNDER RUMBLES]

What are the kitties to do

but buckle together
and work as a team?

Mrs. Sullivan, I... please,
forgive me for being forward,

but your eyes are so beautiful.

[ CATS MEOW]

Wait. This is
an actual movie?

This fall, sparks will fly...

[ MOANING, CATS MEOWING]

Mrs. [MOANS] Sullivan.
Ohh.

Between one guy
who can't get a break...

There's something about you,
Mrs. Sullivan.

And nine cats who break
all the rules.

"Last Will and Testi-meow:

Weekend at Dead Cat Lady's
House II."

Well, somebody in Hollywood
just lost their job.

Written and directed by
Jerry Smith.

I wrote and directed that?
What am I, nuts?

Oh, hey, Morty.
You just missed a preview

for your Dad's
"Citizen Kane."

Doesn't matter.

Hey, if your mother
and I had to split custody,

who would you guys chose?

Doesn't matter.

Breaking news... Academy
Award-Winning actor Jerry Smith

is leading police
on a slow-speed pursuit

after suffering
an apparent breakdown.

Don't even think about it.

Come on.
Are you kidding me, Jerry?

It's just a bunch of dumb
tabloid crap.

It's my life,
and we're watching it.

You did it, Beth.
You really nailed it.

[BURPS] You're a surgeon...
a human surgeon.

Yay, you win.
[ SLURPS ]

Where the hell am I going?

Wh... What are you
asking me for, Jerry?

[BURPS] I'm sitting here [BURPS]
trying to figure out

why the cops don't just
take you out.

I mean [BURPS] they got
a clear shot to your head.

I can't believe our tax dollars
pay for this.

[ DOORBELL RINGS ]

Jerry?

Jerry Smith?

Beth Sanchez, I have been in
love with you since high school.

I hate acting.
I hate cocaine.

I hate Kristen Stewart.

I wish you hadn't gotten
that abortion,

and I've never stopped thinking
about what might have been.

[ METAL MUSIC PLAYS]

Aah!

Ha ha, Hamster in Butt World
Weather is done,

and now it's sports time
coming up.

- Oh, hello, there.
- Good day to you, miss.

BETH:
So, the hamsters live

inside the rectums of those
people?

Yes, sweetie.
That's where the live.

Well, how does that work?

I mean, do the butts look like
little apartments inside?

Yeah, and can they
leave the butt

and, like, walk around
on their own?

I don't know. I'm watching
the same thing you guys are.

Grandpa Rick,
if they leave the butt

and the person wanders off,

how would they find
their butt person again?

I don't know, Summer.
I can't even hear the TV.

All right, that's it.

We're just gonna go there
so you idiots

can ask your stupid
questions all day.

Ooh, family vacation!

[ CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKS ]

Did you get any of that?

It's a good-a show!

What kind of
parents drag their kids away

for the entire week
of spring break?

I'm missing Mike Triscuit's
drug party.

Look at this.
He's already watching

"Euphoria"
to pregame.

Pregame. Game.
Video game.

Yes, yes, drugs and video games.
Poor babies.

What you need is to level up
with a bong rip of nature.

Trust me,
this is good for you.

Can someone just kill me?

Grandpa Rick,
you can kill anything.

No, he can't, Summer.
We're roughing it.

And that means no sci-fi
bullshit.

Isn't that right, Rick?Uh-huh.

Rick, was that a sci-fi
phone call?Shut up, Jerry.

Damn it, I didn't think
she had this number.

Why are you building a Faraday
box to block out the signal?

Oh, my God, Grandpa's
ghosting someone.

I'm not ghosting.
Hey! Give it back, Summer!

"Rick.
Please answer me.

I'm pregnant"?!

Oh, my God, Grandpa,
you fuck boi.

I'm not a fuck boi
Summer!

There's no way those kids
are mine.

Wow. At least we know why Rick
actually came on the trip --

to avoid his
fuck-guy problems.

Why would this person lie?I don't know, honey.

She's addicted
to what the Rick did.

You know, it's -- it's --
it's a tale as old

as my huge dynamite penis.

Can we turn the radio on?

I am not letting
you abandon those kids

like you abandoned me.Oh, my God!

We're going to see
this baby mama right now!

What, like, literally now?

Yes, now!
That's an order.

Aah!

No!

This is exactly
what I was talking about!

Rick, I hope you realize
the tubing permit

was non-refundable!Relax, Jerry, we'll be
in and out in a minute,

and then you can get right back
to your dumb vacation

with a family
that doesn't need you.

Kind of expected
someone to defend me,

but, sure, okay.

Hello, Gaia.
Hold on.

Let me just adjust my
Seismic-to-English translator.

Rick. You came.

- W-Where is she?
- You're looking at her.

I-I-I-I don't understand.

Isn't it obvious, Morty?

I fucked a planet.

So, what, you just go around
knocking up planets now?

I-I-Is that what you do
when I'm at school?

I'm a scientist, Morty.
I try things.

Sex with a living planet?
Big step for mankind.

Yeah, we finally broke
the deadbeat dad barrier.

Ah, where
the magic happened.Gross.

Hey, uh, Gaia, baby,
Big Daddy Rick is here.

What's the problem? Children.

Birth cycle. Now.

Okay, gettin' right into it.

- I am! I am!
- Jesus Christ!

- I am!
- I am!

- Dad, do something! Make it stop!
- You think I know how to stop this?

I thought she was gonna
shit an egg.

Cool vacation, guys.

So happy I got to see
the human geyser

instead of micro-dosing
with my friends.

More coming. Kids.
Need father.

Yeah, um, Baby Quakes,
how big is your orbit again?

I mean, not to say
you get around, but, um...

Are you kidding me?
Look at them!

They look just like you.

Yeah, and snakes
look like dildos, Beth.

What's your point?They do?

The fact is even if they
were mine,

which they're not,
the best parent is evolution.

They'll probably develop harder
skin or maybe even webbed arms.

Man, that'd be cool, huh?
Flying squirrel people?

Yeah, Dad, that approach
worked out great for me.

Beth, I know it looks bad,
but trust me.

This is life
in the galaxy, okay?

It's totally normal.

Fine.
You won't do something, I will.

Welp, there
goes the surprise!

I was gonna have us jump
on the trampoline

after we caught
our first fish.I am!

What?
You're stupid.I am!

- I am! I am!
- Beth, that's not gonna help.

Uh, I hate to
agree with Rick,

but shouldn't
we just let this be?

We're supposed to be
on vacation.

You're unemployed, Jerry!

Every day
is a vacation for you.

Okay, ouch.You guys do
whatever you want.

I'm staying here
and fixing this.

- I am!
- I am!

Goddamn it, Beth,
if you're gonna do it,

at least do it right.

Gaia, baby, gonna need
a little raw iron and steam.

Whatever you need, baby.

So much for camping.Nope.

We are going camping.

There's trees over there.
We're on solid ground.

Mom! Summer, Morty,

go camp with your father.

Ohh, son of a bitch.Son of a bitch.

- I am!
- I am!

Welp, welcome to lack
of abandonment.

Dad, can we please go back

and hang out
with Grandpa's clay people?

Why? Because they might
have a Sega Dreamcast?

Why is it so hard for you two
to let nature in?

Because this sucks ass.
Camping is just

being homeless
without the change.

Well, that attitude is
exactly why we're out here.

You guys wouldn't last
two seconds on your own.

You're only happy when
you're penned in

and drugged up like
some kind of chicken or lemur.

Hey!
I told you kids no phones!

There's not even any service.

Just -- Just let us
be happy for a minute.

You know, maybe if you
two stopped whining

and let your old man
take the reins,

you might actually
learn something.

Here.
Take a bite of this tasty treat.

Oh, you think this s'more
makes you special?

What? Because someone said,
"good job,"

to you once
when you were 10?

That's actually really sad, dad.
Let's be real.

You've been high-roading us
non-stop,

forcing us to do nothing
in the middle of fucking nowhere

because
it's the only way

you're gonna level
the playing field, isn't it?

Because if you move the bar
so low,

you might actually seem like
you're worth a fuck.

Huh.

I'm gonna go take a walk.

Jesus Christ.
you really need to stop

hanging out with Rick.

Okay, so, if we divert
the Lawyer Pipeline here,

they should avoid
the Ethics Tube

and come out spineless enough
to do their job.

Right.
Wait, why are the athletes

going through
the introvert sector?

Obviously so they can bully
the mathematicians

and give us astronomers.God, you are
such a space nerd.

I'm not a nerd. We're raising
a society here, Beth.

If we want them to be
self-sufficient,

they need to get out
into space.

Birth cycle. Coming.

We got you, Gai-Gai! Shoot 'em
hard and up the middle!

We got an oversupply
of teachers

putting a strain
on the literary drive.

Activating playwright
converter!

Aah!

Nice work, honey.
Okay, the therapists

are getting bored.
We need to increase

their supply
of incest porn.20% wasn't enough?

What the hell is that?

The unproductives.
Goddamn it!

How are there
so many of them?Unproductives?

Yeah, deejays, foodies,
influencers.

I just re-circulate them
through until...

Shit, they blew a hole in
the human resources department!

- I'm putting this in your file!
- Downsizing already? - You're fired!

We gotta fix this, Dad.

We can't keep
recycling them through.

I could add an online
college workaround.

Or just push them out
through a pipe in the back.

Same thing.
Same thing.

These kids may not be mine,
but you definitely are.

Look at you.
My little steampunk overlord.

Eeee!

I don't think
he's coming back.

You know, you -- you really
messed him up, Summer.

Yeah, well,
he called me a lemur.

Let's just go
find grandpa.

Maybe he can portal us home
or something.

Should we leave a note?Dad is fine.

He's probably
sucking off a tree

and having the time
of his life right now.

Guess you don't want to learn
how to skip rocks, either.

Aah!

Aaah!

Whoa! Whoa!

Aah! Aaaaaah!

Ohh!

Aaaaaah!

Gah!

Ohhhh!

Aaah!

Aah!

Aah!

Aaah!

Ow! Hey!

Aah!

Aaaaah!

Aaaaaaaah!

Ohh!

Who are you guys?

We are...
unproductives.

Ahh, I get it.

Bunch of bullshit.

What is that?

This?
This is camping.

Camping?
Ooh!

Camping!

Good work there, TickTock.

Keep whittling.
Incredible.

You've almost got smoke
over there, Florflock.

There you go, guys!

Pump those cheeks.

That's the camping spirit.

What the -- Squeeb!

This is not a tent.

It is a new
kind of tent,

with special gutters
to funnel the rain, and a door.

It's a house! No houses!

No doors! Once you have doors,
you have indoors.

Once you have indoors,
you won't want to camp anymore.

Then why do they not camp?

Because they're bad.

Bad. Bad. Bad.

Oh, my God.
Maybe Dad was right.

Maybe we have
no life skills.

I've definitely drank more pee
than I care to remember.

I'm just gonna sit down.

If I die, don't eat my ass.
That'd be weird.

Uh, Summer?

Damn, you think
they got infected

by a mind slug
or something?

Probably drove through a nebula
that made them

see their own fears.

Whoa!
These controls.

It's just like my video game
controllers.

I just wish I could read
these symbols.

This looks just like
Tricia's bong.

Morty, I think these tubes
might contain

all of their
collective knowledge.

Mm!
Well?

I think we got this, bro.

Beth,
you wanna do the honors?

What? Really? Wow.

Okay.
Here we go.

If you told me six days ago
I'd be christening

a generation ship for
my half-rock children,

I would've called
you crazy.

But I guess that's the lesson --
crazy things happen

when you put in the work.
Salud!

Fucking Doopnar!
Sing something!

Great toast, Dad.

- Thanks, sweetie.
- Damn, listen to those pipes.

You sure these
kids are yours?

What, you've never heard me
sing karaoke?

I'm -- I'm pretty good when
someone's in my register,

like the guy that sings
"Circle of Life."

Can't remember his name.
Dresses up weird.

Look at this.
Everyone's happy.

They're about to go
into space.

I know things haven't always
been great with us,

but we do make
a pretty good team.

Uh, Rick?
Can we talk?

Kinda in the middle of
a breakthrough with my daughter.

Go ahead, Dad.
Gaia deserves some time, too.

They're your kids. Yes, about that.

Pam!
It's good to see you, baby!

Um, Gaia?
You know this guy?

Ha! You call her Gaia?

So lame.Is that...

God? Rick. The kids.

I messed up.
You're not their father.

Little ones!
Daddy's here!

I'm sending some fog down.

Feel my presence
through the fog!

Ooh!Beth! What the fuck?
Don't touch it!

You gotta be kidding me.
God is the father?

No hard feelings, okay?

We thought they were yours,
you know,

because they're so small.

Oh, wow. No hard feelings.
Y-You hear that, Beth?

Guy swoops in after we raised
his whole civilization

and tells us he forgives us.
What a fucking mooch!

Don't push me, asshole!

Rick, I think you should go.

Seriously? You really want
this pile of dry ice

to raise your kids?Stop acting like you did
a good job.

You made my kids soft
and empty inside.

This city is a monument
to nothing!

Where is their faith?

Reggie is right.

The children are not ready
to leave.

He can give them more.I mean, maybe we should
just bail, Dad.

At least this guy is immortal
and can stick around.

Bullshit. They're my kids!
We're staying!

See? Now, this is the kind
of shit I'm talking about.

Jerry! Oh, my God!

Is that you?
What the hell are you doing?

Camping.Oh, look, Jerry finally
found his people.

All it took was
a deep enough drip pan.

You labeled these creatures
"unproductive,"

but I have given them
more purpose than ever.

Oh, yeah? They filing your
unemployment forms?

His tongue is sharp,
but it cannot whittle.

The Great Roughing of
It is at hand.

you will now join the One Family
on its Eternal Getaway.

Or join the embers over which
we hold marshmallows

at just the right distance.

Six inches!
Until it gets golden brown!

Don't let it
start on fire!

The carbon
is bad for you!

What's happening?

My children,
I give you my power.

Use it to take what is yours.

Oh, this motherfucker.
Raise the walls!

Walls can't stop us, Rick.
We are chosen.

Sha-boom-boom!

Sorry! Sorry!

Just trying to get
the hang of this thing.

Nice choice of chosen people,
G-diddles.

I guess you'll be playing
the "mysterious ways" card

on that one.You wanna go, bro?

I'll kick your ass myself.Oh, dude,
don't tempt me.

When I'm done with you,
you'll need a staff

to un-part
your fucking face.

Guys. Please.
Not in front of the kids.

Did you for real
just try to smite me?

Siri, triangulate source
of power.

Got you now,
you son of a bitch.

Sweetie,
you handle the hippies.

I'll handle
the off-brand Yahweh.

Kick his ass, Dad!Bear witness.

Now you see my true form.

The clouds were simply a shape
more appealing to Gaia's mind.

No shit. Any form is more
appealing than this.

You look like
Kid Rock fucked Zeus.

Oh, seriously, you expect me
to fight you like this?

You're the size of
four Empire State Buildings.

Alright, motherfucker.

Let's go.

Aaah! Aah!

Ha-ha!
You like that?

Ohh!Here comes some pain!

Ohh!

Ow!

Ow!

And...
that last one should be...

the start button.

Perfect.
I guess we're ready.

Let's show Mom and Dad
what video games

and partying are all about.

Jesus Christ,
was that the wings?

This is not like
a video game!

Oh, my God, make it stop!
Make it stop!

How do I make it stop?!I don't know.
I'm fucking high!

Aah!

Oh, God,
now I'm high, too!

Jerry, that's enough.Oh, hey, babe.

You like these plagues
I'm unleashing on your asses?

No, they're lame.
It's not a great sign

that your army's
on the same side as disease.

Sorry we aren't modern enough
to sort people by value

and shit the losers
through a mean butt tube!

Just admit this is about you
wanting to feel needed!

Says the woman who sold out
her family

for an ounce of approval
from her drunk father!

Well, maybe he drinks
because it isn't easy

to be more powerful
than God.Well, if it's god power

that gets you going,
light some candles

and put on the Billy Ocean
because Moses is home

and he's ready
to burn some bush!

Sha-boom-boom!

Ohh!
Fuck! Ow!

Alright, alright, stop.

Come on, bitch!Look, you win, okay?

Ju-- I don't care
about the kids.

Smite them, raise them
to fuck sheep.

Just keep the city, okay?

My daughter and I
built that thing.

It's important to her.No, bro. I'm a Zeus.

I can literally do anything.

Think I'm gonna hang around
and raise kids?

The only lesson they need
is right here -- fear.

And it looks like
school's out, bitch.

- I think you mean school's in.
- What are --

What are you talking about?
If you're teaching fear,

- then choking me -- school would be in.
- Fine.

School's in, bitch.

Oh.

What the fuck?

Ohh! Are we dead?
D-Did we die?

I don't ever want to be
high again.

I-I got scared straight.

Oh, my God, I got scared
straight.

Fuck. Dad was right.

We -- We think
we know everything,

but maybe we're the ones
who suck.

You kids
are my fucking heroes!

You saved Grandpa's life!
I fucking love you so much!

Papa!
Papa!

We played video games
and got high! We did wrong!

We did wrong!Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, little boopas.

Come on, now. You kids,
you did real good here.

You did good.
Getting high

and playing video games
is the best,

I swear to fucking God.But mom and dad

are gonna be mad.No, hey, hey, look, no.

Fuck your mom and dad.
Your parents are a bag of dicks.

Getting high and playing
video games is the best,

and I will never
sell you out, ever.

Now, we got to get out of here
before this guy

falls out of the sky.
He's generating an ionic cloud

from his own belief system.
Holy shit, Summer,

were you smoking this?
You were basically

inhaling brake fluid.
Jesus!

Mm, yeah.

It's over, Beth. Tell your
people to lower the gates

and pack
their moisture-wicking shirts.

Incoming!

Jerry!

Beth!
Just hold on!

I'm losing my grip!

Jerry.
Squeeb?

Use the s'more, Jerry.

Ow!
You stabbed my hand!

Sorry! Sorry!

Should --
Should we make love?

Jerry, I love you,
but I can literally

smell your balls from here.Oh, wow.

Ask God for a flood next time.
It'll come with a shower.

Noted.

Aw, geez,
that -- that poor guy.

Can you maybe not tell
Mom and Dad?

Relax, it's just a Zeus.
If this was the real God, it--

it'd be a completely
different story.

Rick! What did you do?!

I mean,
gravity did most of it.

So, you, technically.I told you to leave!

Yeah, well, you also asked me
to raise your kids.

Uh, not sure if you heard
the phrase, "pick a lane,"

but --You killed their father!

Father or not, he was
a lying piece of shit.

I don't care who else
stuffed your crust,

but I'm the guy
that showed up.

But I mean, if you want,
I can still power-wash his guts

off the tower
and maybe --Get oooout!

Okay, yeah, she's pissed.

I mean, you killed her
slam piece, Grandpa.

I don't blame her.

See? you put the fire stick
to the wood, and, voilà!

Campfire.You have known about this
the whole time?

I'm not gonna waste my time
building you an ark,

but if your mom gets clingy, you
can use this to get some space.

Is that all you want to say to
your children before you leave?

Oh, yeah, uh,
don't ask me for money.

I mean, Gaia's not gonna
raise those guys

to hunt us down, right?

Oh, most definitely.
I put a tracker on their ship.

I'll blow it up if they come
anywhere near me.

Well, kids, never thought
I'd say this, but,

Summer, you were right.Wait, what?

I thought I wanted
to teach you guys about tents,

but really,
I just wanted to feel important.

I guess sometimes teenagers
do know

what they're talking about,
even if it's mean.

Right, but didn't you, like,
go into god-mode and fight mom?

Love is the only power
that matters, Morty.

No, you had actual power,
and you did jack shit.

That was a divine staff.

You could've cured cancer
or raised the dead.

Instead you made bugs.Well,
I was impressed, Dad.

He saved my life,
no thanks to you.

Your kids got high
on alien mist

and drove the ship
into that Zeus guy's head.

Basically murdered him.Grandpa!

What the hell?!Come on!What? You did.

I mean, not to cast
the first stone,

but, Beth and Jerry, pretty
terrible parenting on your part.

Did you know Summer huffed
a K-Zax Array?

She basically
smoked "The Ring."

Most pilots die
after three days.

And Morty, the fucking moron,
he thought

the ship worked
like a game controller.

What in the Disney Channel fuck
is that?

Maybe help him with
homework next time.

He's clearly
crying for help.

Planets Only.
Planets Only. Planets Only.

Entire systems of steamy,
lush globes

and barely habitable
celestial objects

are drifting through
the void just for you.

Planets Only.
- Let's terraform.

Or colonize me as I am.
- Planets Only.

Oops, there's a hole
in my ozone.

I didn't put it there.
Did you?

I can't fill it by myself.
I'm not smart enough.

Young, dumb,
and orbiting the sun.

The greenhouse is in full effect
at Planets Only.

Oh, I want you to split my
Pangea into distinct continents.

I don't have hydrostatic
equilibrium yet.

Is that something
you can learn?

You get the idea.

Phew!I was watching over your
shoulder for a full minute.

So? I was watching because
it's funny.

It's -- It's -- They-- They--
They're planets,

but they're sexy.
It's a comedic premise.

Yeah. Planets Only.

Planets Only.

﻿RICK: Anyway, that's how
I escaped from space prison!

Oh!
Scary place.

Wow, Rick! That's -- That's
one -- one heck of a story.

I sure do wish I could've
been there to see it happen.

Oh, come on. Who wants to watch
a mad scientist

use handmade sci-fi tools

to take out highly trained
alien guards

when we can sit here
and be a family at Shoney's?

Dad, it's great to have you
back, no matter where we are.

But wouldn't you like
to go home?

Emotionally speaking, honey,
Shoney's is my home.

Yeah, but you just got out
of prison.

I mean, how much of a step up
from that is --

Jerry, get out of the booth,
take all your clothes off,

-and fold yourself 12 times.
- You got it.

[GRUNTING]

Six folds, huh?

W-What, have you guys got me
in a Series 9000?

You cheap insect fucks
didn't think I was worth

your best equipment?

[CHUCKLES]
Man, I told the money bugs.

I said, "You know
who this guy is, right?

You want me to get intel
out of the smartest mammal

in the galaxy, you'd better
give me a decent brainalyzer."

Well, you might as well order
some pancakes,

because I don't see the need
to leave this part of my brain.

Oh, I think you do.

Eventually, you're either gonna
relax your cerebellum...

Shoney's.

...or the Series is going to turn it into mush.

-[ FARTS]
- Relaxed enough? [CHUCKLES]

- I admire you, Rick.
-[ FARTS]

[LAUGHING]

- When I --
-[ FARTS]

- Rick, here's --
-[ FARTS]

[MACHINERY HUMMING]

- What's going on?
- It's hard to tell.

He may have manifested
some sort of butt.

He can do that?

He <i>is</i> the smartest man
in the universe.

[DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYS]

[WHIRRING]

[SIGHS]

I tell you, the Galactic
Federation taking over Earth --

best thing that's ever happened
to this family.

I just got my sixth promotion
this week,

and I still don't know
what I do.

Who cares
how high they promote you?

Everyone just gets paid
in pills.

Well, when you're not sure
what you do for a living,

you can make your own rules.

Summer, show your father
some respect.

He's pulling down
a six-chewable-figure income.

-[ GLASS SHATTERS]
<i>- I'll</i> get that in a moment.

How are everyone's pills?

Oh, Morty, you've hardly touched
your pills.

I kind of had big pills
for lunch, and l...

wasn't gonna eat any more pills.

[GULPS]

Thank you, Conroy.

You spoil us, Conroy.

Grandpa Rick wouldn't put up
with this!

Stop saying his name.
He abandoned us.

Willem Dafoe!

T-That's the guy I couldn't
think of this morning.

Don't make my mistake, Summer.

Don't deify the people
that leave you.

You'll end up a horse surgeon
in a world controlled by aliens

whose medicine keeps horses...
healthy forever.

[SNIFFLES]

Horses live longer
than tortoises now!

Is that what you want
for yourself?

Maybe I just want you to care
if I run away yelling!

Who saved room for pill brulée?

Ooh!
[CHUCKLES]

I can see why you chose
this family-friendly restaurant

to represent your cerebellum.

So safe, so comfortable,
so Shoney's.

But admit it, Rick -- You're
going crazy cooped up in here.

- Let's go visit some memories.
- Oh, any particular ones?

You want to see my first boner

or should we go
straight to the moment

I discovered
interdimensional travel?

Ooh. Your little flappy doodles
are twitching.

Does that mean you're aroused,
or did you just get a signal

that one of your buddies found
a grape?

It's arousal.

Yes, I'd like very much
to visit the memory

of you invenfing
your portal gun.

- Yeah. Well, tough titties.
-[ RUMBLING, GLASS BREAKING]

There's no tougher titty
than a psychotic break, Rick.

Well, that depends on who breaks
first -- me or the titty.

Someone special you remember?

Is that your memory of her
out there --

between where you were on 9/
and your favorite
sports blooper?

[WHOOSHING ]

If we stay here, you'll die,
along with all your memories.

If you take me
where I want to go,

she'll be there, too, won't she?

The day I invented the portal
gun is the day I lost her.

Oh, that sounds cool.

I can get what I want
and you can say goodbye.

[SIGHS]
Fine, but I'm driving.

...as an excuse
to strip away our freedom.

[ DOWN-TEMPO MUSIC PLAYS]

Huh? What are you --
What are you doing?

Grandpa Rick must have
some secret lab, right?

With, like, laser guns
and jets packs and a space tank!

And we can go
break him out of prison!

Look at these dead flies!

Maybe if we arrange them
in a certain order,

it plays a hologram
or it opens a secret door.

Summer, you're freaking me out!

I know things have changed
a lot, and I know you miss Rick,

but getting him back
wouldn't make things better.

And, you know,
we're not doing so bad.

We're miserable, Morty!

There's a mandatory curfew,
their weird calendar made me 47,

and they weaponized
the Eiffel Tower!

I like being 35.
I-l can rent a car now.

Because you suck!

You've been keeping
your lip zipped about it

since Grandpa got arrested,
but the fact is,

you're freaking stoked
to bail on him.

He bails on everybody!

He bailed on Mom
when she was a kid!

He -- He bailed on tiny planet!

And in case I never made this
clear to you, Summer,

he bailed on you.

He left you to rot
in a world that he ruined

because he doesn't care!

Because nobody's special to him,
Summer, not even himself.

So if you really want your
grandpa back, grab a shovel.

The one that won't let you down
is buried in your backyard!

You're right!

What?!
No! I'm not right!

L-I was using ghoulish overkill!

Ghoulish overkill, Summer!

SUMMER:
[GRUNTING]

[THUNDER CRASHING]

Oh, God!
Oh, God!

Whoa, whoa!

- Where are we going?
- To the day it all began --

and ended.

The moment that changed
everything.

MAN: Welcome to McDonald's.
Can I take your order?

Yeah, I'd like to get
a 10-piece McNugget

and, uh, a bunch
of the Szechuan sauce.

Like, as much as you're allowed
to give me.

In 1998, they had this promotion
for the Disney film "Mulan,"

where they -- where they --

they created a new sauce
for the McNuggets

called Szechuan sauce,
and it's delicious!

And then they got rid of it,
and now it's gone.

The only place we're gonna be
able to try it is in my memory.

Rick, you're doing this bit
while your brain is melting.

Okay.
All right, all right.

[ DOWN-TEMPO MUSIC PLAYS]

Is that...

Me.

I used to wear blue pants.

[WHIRRING, ZAPPING]

When'd you make the leap
to interdimensional travel?

I didn't.
I did.

Well, well, well.
If it isn't us.

You know the worst part
about inventing teleportation?

Suddenly you're able to travel
the whole galaxy,

and the first thing you learn is

you're the last guy
to invent teleportation.

Fortunately,
you're about to invent something

much more powerful.

[SQUEALS]

What?

[WHIRRING]

[THUNDER CRASHES]

[MUSIC CONTINUES]

Summer, nobody has to know
about that.

We could put it right back
and pretend we never saw it,

like we did
with Dad's mannequin leg.

Fine. Stay here.
I'll rescue Grandpa myself.

- How are you gonna do that?!
- I don't know yet.

I'll make it up as I go.
That's what Grandpa Rick does.

That's what heroes do.

You want to see
what a hero Rick is?

<i>L-I'll</i> bring you somewhere,
Summer!

- Um...
- My goodness, children.

[WHIRRING]

[STERNLY] Relinquish
the illegal technology

to the nearest
Federation representative.

[NORMAL VOICE ] And then
we'll all play Balderdash.

[ BOTH WHIMPER, SCREAM ]

[DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYS]

[GRUNTS]
Oh, my goodness!

Oh! Oh!
My 900--

[ ELECTRICITY CRACKLING ]

Oh, my God.

I have that exact same top.

What is this place?

And what's with
"Hunger Games" Summer?

That's my sister.
This used to be my home.

Imagine doing anything you want,

then hopping to a timeline
where you never did it.

Imagine going anywhere, anytime,
with nobody able to stop you.

- Sounds lonely.
- Lonely?

Dude, you have yourself --
your infinite selves.

It's a nonstop party

where all the guests
are the only person we like.

You think it's cool
being the smartest man on Earth,

but once we give you
this technology,

you become the smartest thing
in every conceivable universe --

the Infinite Rick, a god.

Enh, pass.

Excuse me?
Bro, Ricks don't pass on this.

Who do you think you are?

A different kind of Rick,
l guess.

Well, we'll see how long
that lasts.

[WHIRRING]

I heard sci-fi noises.
Did you make a breakthrough?

Sort of.

I just took a long
look at myself,

and I don't think this
science thing is gonna pay off.

Well, why don't I get Beth
and we'll go out for ice cream?

That, Diane,
is the last great idea

that will ever be had
in this garage.

[LOUD CHEWING, GRUNTING]

Good roasted Cronenberg,
I assume.

Mom, you're looking...feral.

I can't believe Rick did this.

These are the parts
of Rick's adventures

you don't get to see --
the parts he leaves behind.

All right.
It's been great, guys.

Um, I really
only wanted to stop by here

for a quick "I told you so."

- So, uh...
- Looking for this?

- What are you doing with that?!
- It stinks of Rick.

'[ GRUNTS]
- No! Why?!

Why would you do that?!

W-What is the matter
with you people?!

You're a bunch
of back savages --

backwood savage morons!

You can never leave.
She cannot remain.

She stinks of Rick.

Hold your fire! Hold your fire!
I'm Morty C-137.

We detected a compromised
portal gun.

- Where is your Rick?
- He's in prison.

Summer.

He got captured
by the Federation,

and we were going to rescue him.

Very troubling.

We can't risk Citadel secrets

falling into
the Federation's hands.

We'll dispatch
S.E.A.L. Team Ricks immediately.

to break into the prison
holding C-137...

Boo-yah.

...and assassinate him.

Boo-nah?

Wow.
This sauce is fucking amazing.

You said it was promoting
a movie?

[SLURPING]

[ DOWN-TEMPO MUSIC PLAYS]

Carry the 3, add a 2.

I got it.

I fucking got it!

Whoa.
I-Is that it -- the portal gun?

Yeah.

That's the three lines of math
that separates my life as a man

from my life
as an unfeeling ghost.

Awesome possum.

[WHIRRING]

Mission Control,
you getting this?

Holy shit, yes!

W Yes!
e got m

- Yeah! All right!
- Thanks, Rick.

I'll try to remember
to shut off the brainalyzer.

Actually, I think it shuts off
automatically

once your brain is liquid.

Don't know, don't care.

Pull me out.

Hey, pull me out.
Can you hear me?

Nope, they cannot.

- Why not?
- Because the code you uploaded

wasn't actually
my portal-gun formula.

It was a virus giving me full
control over the brainalyzer.

What are you talking about?
This is a memory.

Y-You can't alter details
of a memory.

True, but you can alter
anything you want

about a totally fabricated
origin story.

It's a trap! Abort!
I'm still in his Shoney's!

Repeat --
We never left his Shoney's!

Mission accomplished, boys.
Pull me out.

Roger that.

Have fun in what's left
of my brain.

I'm gonna transfer to yours.

Oh, there's not enough room
for all my genius,

so I'm leaving you with my fear

my desire to play the trumpet,

my tentative plans
to purchase a hat,

and six years
of improv workshops.

- It's a trap!

- Abort! We never left his --

[LAUGHS]

No!

[MACHINERY HUMMING]

RICK:
Another day, another dollar.

Am I a great insect creature
or what?!

Congratulations, Agent.

You'll be highly commended
for this.

Always wait for permission
to [BURPS]

Feel accomplishment --
That's my motto.

One thing still perplexes me --

Why would Rick Sanchez
turn himself in?

Well, I'm just a dumb-ass bug,
but it's possible Rick knew

he'd be interrogated
at this facility,

where we not only keep
our most wanted,

but our most sensitive data.

Anyone here with level-access could [BURPS]

I don't know.
Collapse the government.

I'm just gonna go take a dump.

Is it cool if I use
the level-9 bathrooms?

W-What's the level-master access code again?

Oh, that's easy --
8-3 --

Oh, yeah!

S.E.A.L. Team Ricks
in the house!

[SCREAMING]

Hi, Rick.

Bye, Rick.

[DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYS]

D-99, y-you okay?

[GRUNTING]

I'm bummed I didn't get to give
that insect dick a test drive.

Wait, wait, wait, wait!
T-The Council of Ricks sent us.

We have your Morty and Summer.

They're prisoners
on the Citadel.

- Great.
-[ GRUNTS ]

- Security breach in room 6755.
-[ ALARM BLARING]

Lovely.

Not only is my plan screwed up,
I also forgot how to improvise.

- All security people approach.
-[ GRUNTS]

Security breach.

[ DOWN-TEMPO MUSIC PLAYS]

[WHIRRING]

A city of Grandpas?

MORTY:
It's the Citadel of Ricks.

All the different Ricks
from all the different realities

got together to hide here
from the government.

But if every Rick hates
the government,

why would they hate Grandpa?

Because Ricks hate themselves
the most.

And our Rick is the most...
himself.

Not anymore, homey.

S.E.A.L. Team Ricks
turned his unibrow

into two brows -- with a bullet.

[ LAUGHTER]

Your Rick's dead!
Your Rick's dead!

[DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYS]

Sir, Rick D-99 is returning
from the mission alone.

Apparently, S.E.A.L. Team Ricks
suffered heavy casualties.

Bring him in.

He says he'll only talk
to a Rick with higher clearance.

La-di-da.
Give me that.

D-99, this is the commander in
chief of the Citadel's militia.

Go-- [ BURPS]
Good enough.

[WHIRRING]

He's a spy. Blow him up.
I'm gonna go take a shit.

Operating an unregistered
portal gun,

radicalizing a Summer,

conspiring
with a traitorous Rick.

How do you plead?

How is this a fair trial?

O-Our lawyer is a Morty!

It's not fair, you have no
rights, and he's not a lawyer.

We just keep him here
because he's fun.

Look at him go.
[LAUGHS]

[LAUGHS]
Yeah!

We'll be lenient
if you renounce your Rick.

What say you, Summer?

I say fuck you!
My grandpa was my hero.

You killed him
because you were jealous of him.

That's pretty obvious
from the haircuts.

So do what you want to me,
but let my brother go.

He already renounced Rick.

<i>Marty'?</i>

-[ WHISPERS INDISTINCTLY]
- What?

N-No, I don't want to see
your pog collection.

I don't renounce Rick,
and I never have.

I was just trying to protect
my sister.

I wanted you to have
a normal life.

That's something you can't have
when Rick shows up.

Everything real turns fake.
Everything right is wrong.

All you know is that you know
nothing and he knows everything.

And, well -- well, he's not
a villain, Summer,

but he shouldn't be your hero.

He's more like a demon
or a super fucked-up god.

Let's not suck the ghost
of his dick too hard.

He was a terrorist,
and now he's dead.

Oh, yeah? If you think
my Rick's dead, he's alive!

And if you think you're safe,
he's coming for you!

[ALL MURMURING]

[WHIRRING]

[WHISTLING]

Hey! Whoa, whoa!
What are you doing in here?

This area is for teleporting
the entire Citadel

to somewhere else
using only buttons and dials.

Yeah?
Well, it's a bad idea

to have it designed that way
then, isn't it?

[WHIRRING]

[DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYS]

-[ SCREAMING]
- What the fuck?

We just teleported into
a Galactic federal prison!

- I'm gonna go take a shit.
-[ ALARM BLARING]

Order in the court!
Whoa! What the hell?!

Oh, my God!

[SCREAMING]

Aah!

Wait, wait, wait, wait!
No, no, no!

[INDISTINCT SHOUTING]

Whoa!
[SCREAMING ]

Whoa!

[MUSIC CONTINUES]

The Citadel has been teleported
to [BURPS] Federation space.

It's doomed.
This has to be C-137, you guys.

- What are we gonna do?!
- You know he's coming for us.

All right! Calm down!
We have his Summer as a hostage.

Obviously, I get her.

You guys play Rick, Laser,
Scissors for the Morty.

W-What the hell is that?

Payback.

[SCREAMING]

Grandpa Rick!

- Duh.
- You're alive!

- Rick!
- Morty, take this.

You're gonna need it later.

[MUSIC CONTINUES]

Hold on. Hold on.
Whoa!

COUNCIL MEMBER:
That's enough, Rick.

What -- What's this
supposed to accomplish?

We have infinite grandkids.

You're trying to use Disney
bucks at a Caesars Palace here.

[GASPS ] That's a bluff.
He's bluffing, sir. He loves me.

You're a rogue Rick --
irrational, passionate.

You love your grandkids.
You came to rescue them.

I came to kill you, bro.

That's not even
my original Summer.

Oh, my God. He's not bluffing.
He's not bluffing!

- R-Rick?
- Why not shoot through her?

Twenty yards,
nine-gauge plasma pistol.

My first shot would liquify
her insides and injure you,

second shot adds recoil.

The risk to me is minimized
if I wait for you to shoot her,

which I'm encouraging you to do.

- What the fuck?!
- Or let her go,

which I will reward
with a quicker death.

Because you love her!

Because it's incentive for you
to give me my cleanest shot,

which will be
your least painful death.

But if you want to die slower
than that, I'm super into it.

All you got to do to get
that started is kill the girl.

- I hate you!
- Not an issue, sweetie.

That's enough!
Drop the gun, Rick!

Morty, I know you're too stupid
to get this,

but you're really
fucking this up right now.

I'm not letting you let
my sister die!

Drop the gun!

I wasn't gonna let her die,
you fucking moron!

- Ha!
- Aww.

The point is he thought
I was going to.

I totally did, by the way.
You're a fucking moron, Morty.

Morty, you fucking idiot!

RICK: You're a serious
fucking idiot, Morty!

You basically killed us all!

- You're the worst!
- You're dumb as a bag of sand!

[INDISTINCT SHOUTING]

[SCREAMING]

Who's stupid now, bitch?!

Morty!
We just got him back!

[LAUGHS]
That was amazing, Morty.

Oh, my God.
Wow.

Okay.
Let's wrap this --

Good job, Morty.
Let's go, kids.

What?!
What happened?

Oldest Rick trick in the book.

"Fake gun.
Shoot me in standoff."

- Brilliant!
- Ha! Yeah.

G-Good thing I saw that note.

[DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYS]

[SCREAMING]

Couldn't we just portal home?

Not until I finish
what I started.

[GRUNTS]

And that is how you get level-access without a password.

Freeze!

Employee of the month,
ladies and gentlemen.

So what are you doing
with level-9 access anyways?

Destroying the [BURPS]
Galactic government.

- Awesome!
- Whoa! Cool!

Are you going to set all their
nukes to target each other?

Ooh, or -- or reprogram
their military portals

to disintegrate
their entire space fleet?

Good pitches, kids.
I'm almost proud.

But watch closely
as Grandpa topples an empire

by changing a one...to a zero.

[PEN SCRATCHING, DOOR OPENS]

Mr. President, the Blemflarck's
value just dropped to nothing.

What do you mean?

I mean our single centralized
Galactic currency

just went from being worth one
of itself to zero of itself.

- Dear God, no.
- Calm down, people.

Deploy the Galactic militia
and declare martial law.

Yes, sir.

Uh, what should I pay them with?

Their payment is the honor
they'll feel to serve their --

Wait. Who's paying me
to yell at this guy?

I can answer that -- for money.

I never thought I'd live
to see this day.

Gentlemen!
Gentlemen!

There's a solution here
you're not seeing.

- Give me your jacket!
- Give me those pants!

[INDISTINCT SHOUTING]

[INDISTINCT SHOUTING]

[DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYS]

I want more jackets!

He who controls the pants
controls the galaxy!

[WHIMPERING]

[ GASPS 
[WHIMPERING]

No longer will the insects
have domain over surface world!

[MUSIC CONTINUES]

[WHIMPERING]

Jerry, what the hell
is happening?!

The Galactic government
collapsed.

- Are you okay?
- Look.

I'm not proud to share this,
but the truth is,

I just kept crawling,
and it kept working.

-[ EXHALES DEEPLY]
- Oh, I'm glad you're okay.

Are we ever going to stop paying
for indulging your father?

Our children, our planet,
our jobs.

Is there anything left to lose?

Just each other,
and I'll never let you go.

And I'm so sorry
I ever did this to us.

Guess who dismantled
the government.

- Please don't leave me again.
- I never will, baby.

I was right!
He turned himself in on purpose!

It was all part of his plan!

Jerry, is there any light beer
left?

It's insane what you miss
in prison.

Um, okay.
No.

No,no,no.
Foot-down time.

No. You're right.
Where's the vodka?

Beth, it's him or me!

Seems like you guys need
some privacy.

I'll, uh, I'll be in the garage.

What the fuck?!
Not cool, Jerry!

A man's garage is his castle.

[WHIRRING, BEEPING]

Jerry's going to spend
some time...divorced.

Oh. Oh, I-I'm sorry
to hear that, sweetie.

I hope I had nothing
to do with that.

Oh, God. Dad, that is not
your burden to bear.

I feel terrible
that I misjudged you.

This is gonna be good for Jerry.

- For everybody.
- For everybody.

-[ CELLPHONE WHOOSHES]
- I better tend to Jerry

before he changes his mind
and doesn't move out.

I will leave you two
to your adventures.

Oh, my God.

Nancy says they're drawing
and quartering aliens

in the school courtyard,

and it technically counts
as patriotism.

Geez! Are my parents seriously
gonna get divorced?

All right, Rick.
I'm gonna go to my -- Gah!

Not so fast, Morty.
You heard your mom.

We've got adventures to go on,
Morty, just you and me.

And sometimes your sister
and sometimes your mom,

<i>but never your dad.</i>

You want to know why, Morty?
Because he crossed me.

Okay. Take it easy, Rick.
T-That's dark.

Oh, it gets darker, Morty.

Welcome to the darkest year
of our adventures.

First thing that's different --

-no more Dad, Morty.
- Oh, geez.

He threatened to turn me in
to the government,

so I made him and the government
go away.

Oh, fuck.

I've rep[BURPS]laced them both
as the de facto patriarch

of your family
and your universe.

Your mom wouldn't have
accepted me

if I came home without you
and your sister,

so now you know the real reason
I rescued you.

I just took over the family,
Morty,

and if you tell your mom
or sister I said any of this,

I'll deny it,
and they'll take my side

because I'm a hero, Morty.

Now you're gonna have to go
and do whatever I say, Morty,

Forever!

And I'll -- I'll go out
and I'll find some more of that

"Mulan" Szechuan teriyaki
dipping sauce, Morty.

- What are you talking about?
- Because that's --

that's what this is all about,
Morty!

- Szechuan?
- That's my one-armed man!

I'm not driven by avenging
my dead family, Morty!

That was fake!

L-I'm driven by finding
that McNugget sauce.

I want that "Mulan"
McNugget sauce, Morty!

- That's my series arc, Morty!
- What the hell?

If it takes nine seasons, I want
my McNugget dipping sauce --

- Szechuan sauce, Morty.
- What are you talking about?

That's what's gonna take us

-all the way to the end, Morty.
- What are you talking about?!

Nine more seasons, Morty.

Nine more seasons until I get
that dipping Szechuan sauce.

- What is that?!
- For 97 more years, Morty!

What are you talking about?!

I want that McNugget sauce,
Morty!

[ DOWN-TEMPO MUSIC PLAYS]

[WHIRRING]

Is it ready?

Yes.
We can bring it online now.

Do it.

[WHIRRING]

I am Phoenix Person.

Phoenix Person?
Is that what we settled on?

I thought we all agreed
on Cyber Bird.

Y-You said you didn't care
what he was called

as long as we brought him back.

Yeah, but Phoenix Person?

Fine. Fuck it.
Who cares?

[GRUNTS]

Ka-kaw!

﻿Steve,
I just got a weird e-mail.

Did you buy us airline tickets?

Aw, shoot. It was supposed
to be a surprise.

I wanted to thank you

for letting me live here
all this time,

so I'm treating the family
to a vacation!

Steve, you're so sweet.

- Thanks, Uncle Steve!
- Best Uncle ever.

Look out, world.

The Smith family
is going to Paris!

SUMMER: Yeah! Awesome!

Rick, I don't like glowing
rocks in the kitchen trash!

Well, I don't like

your unemployed genes
in my grandchildren, Jerry,

but life is made
of little concessions.

I... you know what?

You're gonna land
on your feet, Jer.

Some company out there's
gonna thank their lucky stars

they hired my little brother.

Who the fuck are you?

My goofy brother, Steve.

[ CHUCKLES ] He's been
living here almost a year now.

Are you losing your mind?

Hey, someone's been spending

too much time
around glowing rocks.

- Am I right?
- [ LAUGHTER ]

[ SCREAMING ]

- Oh, my god!
- Call an ambulance!

JERRY: Oh, god! Steve!

What the hell, Rick?!
What the hell?!

Will everybody just relax
for a second?

There's no such thing
as an "Uncle Steve."

That is an alien parasite.
[ SCREECHES ]

[ BOTH GASP ]

But I've known him
my whole life.

No, you haven't, Jerry.

These telepathic
little bastards,

they embed themselves
in memories,

and th-then they use
those to multiply

and spread out,
take over planets.

It's... it's disgusting.

Steve wasn't real?

He's a real piece of shit.

This is a big one.
Somebody probably

tracked it in last week
on the bottom of their shoe

on a piece of alien fruit.

- Someone?
- Get off the high road, Summer.

We all got pink eye

because you won't stop
texting on the toilet.

But Uncle Steve taught me
how to ride a bike!

No, "Steve" put that memory
in your brain

so he could live in your house,
eat your food, and multiply.

We could be infested
with these things.

[ BELCHES ]
So we got to keep an eye out

for any zany, wacky
characters that pop up.

Ooh, whee!

Whatever you want, Rick!
We're here to help!

Thanks, Mr. Poopybutthole.

I always could count on you.

♪♪

♪♪

All right. There's six of us,
and that's it.

Me, Morty, Jerry, Beth,
Mr. Poopybutthole, and Summer.

Maybe you got the first one
in time, Rick!

- Can't afford to chance it.
- [ BEEP ]

Dad, why does our house
have blast shields?

Trust me, Beth,
you don't want to know

how many answers
that question has.

Ooh, gosh,
it feels claustrophobic!

Reminds me of that time

we all got stuck
in the elevator together.

Y... remember that?
After "The Hulk" musical?

[ GRUNTING ] 
[ MUZAK PLAYING]

Jerry, buttons don't work better
if you hit them harder,

And foam fists
don't make you strong.

I know. Friends make you strong.

I watched
the same musical you did.

Why couldn't I bring
my portal gun?

[ WINCES ]

Why did all the drinks
have to be extra large?

Oh, the Hulk. I just got that.

Just pee your pants. I did it
the minute we got stuck.

Oh, oh, yeah, yeah, shame me.

At least when I'm disgusting,
it's on purpose.

Oh, y'all, we're gonna be fine.

I've always been here for
you guys, and I always will be.

[ CHUCKLES ]
Somebody call for repairs?

ALL: Yay! Cousin Nicky!

It's me, cousin Nicky.

I'm walkin' here!
I mean, I'm not.

I'm crouched
in the elevator shaft,

but hey, I'm walkin' here!

[ LAUGHTER ]

It's true.

We really do get into some
crazy situations as a family,

mostly when
we're cooped up like this.

Hey, maybe
Mr. Poopypants is right.

L-let's get some fresh air.

Come on, cousin Nicky.
You heard Rick.

We have to stay quarantined

until we know that there's
no more of these things.

I hear you, Morty.

Back in Brooklyn,
we got a sayin'...

"We're walkin' here!"
[ LAUGHTER ]

Nicky, get...

Oh! [ GASPS ]

[ GROANING ] What the...?

Cousin Nicky was a parasite?!

Six, Morty! There's supposed
to be six of us!

If there's seven, then
that means somebody's not real.

But how did you know
it was Nicky?

I guessed. That's why I
aimed for his shoulder.

So we can't trust
any of our memories now?

Nicky was the reason we found
that old Nazi submarine.

Did that not even happen?

Well, of course it happened.

Now that I possess
the mighty staff of Rah-gubaba,

the world will tremble
before the Fourth Reich!

This is the last time

I ask you for help
on my history final, Rick.

Hey, we got a word for Nazis
back in Brooklyn, pal.

I'm comfortable being
called a Nazi.

You think there's some other
word that will hurt my feelings?

Yeah. Think before
you talk shit.

Rah-gubaba,
help me kill America!

ALL: Mr. Beauregard!

After due consideration,
I have elected not to retire.

- ALL: Yeah!
- Oh, thank god!

Now, I believe someone
has a final exam to attend.

Set a course
for Morty's high school.

Perhaps I'm biased, but if
that story never happened,

then I wouldn't still be
the family butler.

[ CHUCKLES ] Dare to dream.

Wait.

And if Mr. Beauregard
wasn't our butler,

it's safe to say the family'd be
in a hell of a lot of trouble.

[ LAUGHTER ]
No! Don't flashback!

You're just gonna make
more swelling.

- Don't worry, Jerry.
- Just relax.

We called the fire department.

You know they won't
come here anymore.

[ GRUNTING ]

[ ALL GASP ]

Marmalade is served.

- Yeah!
- Yeah! Yeah!

[ JERRY LAUGHS ] Oh, whee!

I guess I take back what I said
about British cuisine.

[ LAUGHTER ]

[ LAUGHTER ] Take that, Summer!

We're trying to sleep.

I don't want
to go to the dance alone.

MR. BEAUREGARD:
Then perhaps you shouldn't.

Aww. Mr. Beauregard.

- Shall we, master Morty?
- We shall.

Oh, wait,
don't leave without letting

Photography Raptor
take a picture.

[ RAPTOR SCREECHES ]
[ CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKS ]

[ LAUGHTER ]

Everybody stop remembering!

These parasites
are like bed bugs,

and every flashback
is another mattress. Look!

There's only supposed to be
six people in this house.

But there's always been 10.

No!

Uh, the fact
that I wrote this number down

means that
there's four parasites.

You sure about that, Rick?

Begging your pardon,
master Rick,

but I seem to recall
a great deal of confusion

surrounding that number.

All right, there's six of us.

[ BELCHES ] And that's it.

Me, Morty, Jerry,
Beth, Mr. Poopybutthole,

Frankenstein, Sleepy Gary,
Photography Raptor,

Mr. Beauregard, and Summer.

Uh, dad, that's like 10 people.

6, 10, what's the difference?

I just love the number for no reason!

Where's my pencil at?

Here, Rick! Use me!

Oh, thanks, Pencilvester!

Yeah, I-I g...
I guess that is what happened,

but I-I don't get
why I would do that.

Everybody makes mistakes, Rick.

Why do you think
I have one of these?

[ LAUGHTER,
CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKS ]

That's it. Photos.

Hard evidence.

You're not in any of my photos,
Mr. Poopybutthole.

Well, what do you know
about this?

You're not in any of mine.

All I have are pictures of me
and my friends from school.

What? What teenage girl
has pictures of her family?

It's not like we're
Mormon or dying.

I will admit it's suspicious
that Summer's only friend

is a magic ballerina lamb
that we've never seen.

Summer!

Tinkles!

It's past my bedtime.

- But we never get to...
- Hi, everybody.

I'm Tinkles,
and these are my friends.

[ ALL SIGH ]

See, everyone? Tinkles is real.

That means so am I.

- Sorry, Summer.
- Man, I'm sorry, Summer.

I was on the wrong side
of the pitchfork on this one.

Okay, look, we shouldn't need
evidence or logic

to know who's family
and who isn't.

I know who the Smiths are.

I've known Beth
since High School.

And her husband, sleepy Gary,

is hands down
my absolute best friend.

Thanks, Jerry.

Beyond that,
no offense to any of you,

but all bets are off.

Look, I'm not used to being
this unsure for this long.

I'm just gonna aim for shoulders
starting with the weird girl.

Aah!

- Grandpa Rick!
- Hold still, "Summer."

Rick, that is my daughter.

Oh, yeah? Well, what if you just
think that, sleepy Gary?

I've known you for 15 years.
Don't make me hurt you.

Rick, these are
our family and friends,

the people we barbecue with.

Have you forgotten the barbecue?

Wait,
why would you want me to...

You're one of them, aren't you?

Rick. You love
those barbecues, Rick.

You love them. Hai!

Remember it, Rick?

Shut up, Hamurai!
Shut up, Amish Cyborg!

- Watch me, baby.

I'm like Tom Cruise from,
um, "Cuisine"

or w-whatever that movie's
called where he makes drinks.

Yeah, check me out.

I'm like Tom Cruise
from "Cuisine."

[ CHUCKLES ] Yeah.

Is that what it's called?
"Cuisine"?

Wow! Hey, everybody.

Let's give it up
for the grillmaster Rick!

Rick! Rick! Rick!

[ ALL CHANTING "RICK" ]

Wait.

[ BREATHING HEAVILY ]

Noooooo!

Shoot. Now look.

It's like
a "Where's Waldo?" page.

Can you find me?

Check out
all these zany characters.

We'll be right back
after these messages.

I think
you should put down the gun

and we should get you
to a doctor.

What do you say we take down
these blast shields?

- ALL: yeah.
- I can't do that, sleepy Gary.

All right,
everybody listen to me.

I don't know
if any of you guys are real,

but this house has been infested
with fake loved ones

that spread
through fake memories,

and our planet will be destroyed
if they get out.

[ GRUNTS ]

But, Rick,
even you have to admit

you do tend
to overreact to stuff.

You guys, we got to hurry.

I just got back from Walmart.

They're selling Nintendo 3DS
systems for $149.99 on sale,

plus every time you buy one,
you get a $50 gift card.

Brings the total price down
to $110 after tax.

Now, listen, we can flip
those sons of bitches

for 230 bucks apiece easy!

They're all limited-edition
"Zelda" ones.

Hurry! Hurry! Come with me!

We can be rich,
and we also all get to keep one

and we can play Nintendo games!

Nintendo, give me free stuff.

Okay, yes, I definitely
remember doing that,

but also, I would never do that.

Don't overreact, Rick.

Sleepy Gary, a word?
Sure, Jerry.

Rick, keep a level head, okay?

'Cause I'll tell you a secret
about Frankenstein...

He's actually
Frankenstein's monster.

- Ow!
- He's my son!

And if you hurt him, you'll
have to kill me, Rick!

[ GROWLS ]

Dad, I'm so confused!

I know, Morty Jr.
I'm sorry.

I ended up lying to you
and yelling at you

just like my parents
did to me.

You know, parents are just
kids having kids.

One minute, you like
how a shiny robot looks.

The next minute,
you're in a fist fight

with your alien son.

I'm an alien?

We all have bad
impulses, bad thoughts.

We just have to learn
to channel them

into something
constructive.

But I want to murder
everyone I see.

Well, you know, I mean,
maybe there's a job out there

for people that feel
that way.

MAN:
Actually, there is.

Hi. I'm Brad Anderson,
creator of

the nationally syndicated
comic strip "Marmaduke."

You should consider being
a creative.

I'm haunted by uncontrollable
thoughts

of mutilation
and sexual assault

on a near daily basis.

But, you know, I channel it
all into my work.

- Oh. Wow.
- Huh.

I never got that impression
from reading "Marmaduke."

Well, did you get
the impression

I was trying to make
you laugh?

Tell me that wasn't
Brad Anderson.

Aw, see?
You hear that, Morty Jr.?

Maybe you could try being
a creative of some kind.

Maybe!
I always have sort of wanted

to see my face
on the back of a novel.

I mean, what I really want to do
is slit people's throats,

but beyond that...

I know you can do it,
son.

I think it's time I get
a place of my own.

I promise I'll call you
every day I need money

or a place
to do laundry.

[ GROWLING AFFECTIONATELY ]

Aaaaaaah!

[ whoosh! thud! ]

So, I assume this novel
your son writes

is gonna pay for my rear axle?

Isn't it interesting,
Summer,

that after all that stuff
we just did,

nothing really mattered
and there was no point to it?

Kind of makes you wonder,
huh -- about nothing?

Are you sure it doesn't
make you re-evaluate

your policy about taking
girls on adventures?

No. I'd say, given
what we've been through,

that I was right
the whole time

and any epiphanies
about gender politics were

a projection of your feminine
insecurity.

But, hey, why don't you have
a pink spaceship?

Go ride around and have
a jolly old time.

Maybe that'll shut you up.
- Dad? Summer?

Where were you guys
this whole time?

On Gazorpazorp.
Where were you?

I was reading
a newspaper.

Oh, that's interesting, Beth.
You know, it's funny.

l-I-I heard about a little bit
of news myself.

Take a look.
T-Take a listen.

Mortimer Smith, Jr.,

New York Times
bestselling author,

your book is about innocence,
the definition of it,

and, inevitably,
its impossibility.

ls it autobiographical?

Certainly.

I mean, all writing is,
in my opinion.

But my, uh --
[ CLEARS THROAT ]

My father kept me locked
in the house

until I was a teenager.

And there was violence

and, uh,
threats of poison gas --

but also dancing.

But you persevered
and created this masterpiece

from your suffering.

Smith Jr.'s mind-bending novel,
"My Horrible Father,"

in every store
and on everyone's mind.

Pick it up.
We'll be right back.

It's a thankless job, Morty.

You did the best you could.

I hope he's eating enough.

Did you get any of that?

It's a good-a show!

﻿All right, Morty,
you ready for our adventure

to the Lost City of Atlantis?

Ready as I'll ever be, Rick.

-[ PORTAL OPENS]
- Oh, for fuck's sake.

Hello. I'm Rick K-22.
This is my Morty.

We're going from
reality to reality

asking Ricks to contribute

to the Citadel of Ricks
Redevelopment Fund.

What are you, stupid?

We're done with
the Citadel of Ricks.

I was [BURPS] never on board
with it in the first place.

That's why I murdered everyone
in charge and left it to rot.

Oh, that was you.

- They tried to murder him first.
- Aw, geez.

Well, you'll be happy to know
that the council's gone now.

Yeah, he knows.
He murdered them.

- You want to rein in your Morty?
- Every day.

The Citadel of Ricks
Redevelopment Fund donates --

Morty, he's not gonna
[BURPS] donate.

You're pitching
the Policeman's Ball

to a black teenager here.

- Let's go.
- You don't have to be a dick.

I think you know
that's not true.

Geez. I didn't know there were
still Ricks and Mortys

living on the Citadel.

I wonder what their
day-to-day lives are like.

Well, you can keep
wondering that

while we go on a fun, fresh,

self-contained adventure
to Atlantis.

Anyone continuing to explore
the Citadel is either stupid

or one of
the unfortunate millions

held hostage
by their terrible ideas.

Man, I'm glad
I'm not one of them!

ANNOUNCER RICK:
Citadel Morning News.

News about the Citadel
in the morning,

pretty self-explanatory.

Good morning.
I'm Rick D-716B.

- And I'm Rick D-716.
- Must be nice.

Coming up, gravity outages
in East Sanchez Heights.

And is your uranium-powered
cellular matrix

making you sick?

The answer may not surprise you.

It's -- Yes, it's uranium.

Those stories and more
after this break.

SAM ELLIOT: 60 iterations
off the central finite curve,

there's a Rick
that works more with wood

than polarity plating.

His name is Simple Rick,
but he's no dummy.

He realized long ago

that the greatest thing
he'd ever create

was his daughter.

I love Daddy!

SAM ELLIOT:
We captured that moment.

We run it on a loop
through Simple Rick's mind,

and the chemical
it makes his brain secrete

goes into every Simple Rick's
"Simple Wafers" Wafer Cookie.

Come home to
the impossible flavor

of your own completion.

Come home to Simple Rick's.

Just one day remains before
our newly democratic Citadel

elects its first President.

It's anyone's race
among the Rick candidates.

But a certain other candidate
should be getting

at least one vote
for most adorable.

That's right. The Morty party
candidate's still in the race,

and you just gotta
love him for that.

RICK D-716: Here you see him
in his little Morty suit waving.

RICK D-716B: Isn't that
adorable? Little jackass.

RICK D-716: Uh, yeah,
I think we actually have

the audio for his speech here.

"Aw, geez. Aw, man.

I'm gonna lose the election
and stuff."

<i>[BOTH LAUGH]</i>

We had a good run, sir,

but I think it's time
to pull out of the race.

I feel pretty confident
about tonight's debate.

You shouldn't, sir.
You should be terrified.

Maybe you should find
a little faith, young man.

You don't pay me to have faith.

And we're the same age!

[ALL CHEERING]

- Aah!
- Whoa!

Oh. Sorry.
I-l was expecting --

A Rick partner?

Lesson one, rookie,
expect the unexpected.

Now, get in.

Mortys are human!

Get the fuck off the car,
you Rickless fuckin' animal!

- Whoa!
- MORTY COP: The election's

got these yellow shirts
more riled up

than a picture-day Jessica.

That's pretty harsh, sir.

So report me.
Nobody gives a fuck.

Look, I'm just saying,
it makes me a little sad

to hear a Morty cop
calling Mortys animals.

Well, it makes me sad
to hear another Rick cop

buying into his
sensitivity training.

Well, I'm glad to know
there's more like me.

Oh, there was one.

Why do you think that seat
was empty?

Almost as amusing as
when your first Rick

was decapitated on
Zorpantheon Nine.

Or was that your third Rick?
How many Ricks have you had?

- Five.
- I see.

So you are top of the class
in something.

Tomorrow you'll be transferred
to your new Ricks.

Hopefully
they will be your last.

Yes, Slow Ri--

this time yet?

Anything's possible, Tall Morty.

-[ GROANS]
-[ LAUGHTER]

[BELL RINGS]

I guess we won't be seeing
each other after this, huh?

I say we make
our last day count.

I say...we go to
the Wishing Portal.

- That's a myth.
- It's not a myth.

My first Rick's fourth Morty

knew a Rick
whose Morty went there.

If we're not here
for graduation,

our butts are gonna wind up
in Morty Town.

I thought your last Rick
fused you with a lizard,

not a chicken.

Okay, fine. I'm in.

Me too.

- What the hell?!
- I thought I saw a fly.

[ALARM BLARING]

SUPERVISOR RICK:
[WHISTLES]

Listen up, fuck nuts.

I've been your supervisor
for five years,

but all shitty things
must come to an end,

and I have been promoted
to regional manager.

[MOCK CHEERING]

Yeah, I feel the same way.
May be never meet again.

Of course, that makes

the position of supervisor
available,

so, as of next week,
the ass you'll be kissing

will be that of...

K-83, affectionately
known as Cool Rick.

-[ ALL GRUMBLING]
- I know I'm new to the Citadel,

and some of you might not think
I put in my time,

but what can I say?

I'm Cool Rick!

Yo! Ha! Ha!
Check me out!

All right knuckle[BURPS]heads,
any questions?

All right, then, back to work,
you gold rickers.

[HIP-HOP MUSIC PLAYS]

No Ricks, no families,

high off their asses,
and running amuck.

Mortys are raised
to be sidekicks.

Without a side to kick,
they just start kicking.

They were --
They were about my height,

around 14 years old.

Oh, their -- their shirts
were yellow!

Yeah, make sure
you get <i>that</i> down.

Any mutations, augmentations?

Uh, three eyes? A tail?
Maybe a buzz cut?

No.
Just four normal Mortys.

- Normal?
- Put it in your blog.

Let me turn over a few rocks.

Aw, geez.
Hey, what's goin' on, fellas?

Aw, geez, man.
Nothing, man.

We're just hanging out
and stuff.

I hear that.
Aw, geez.

I guess I'm supposed to be
figurin' out

who robbed the store
across the street.

But, aw, geez, I don't know.

Aw, geez man, that sucks

that your Rick's
making you do that.

He's not my Rick.
He's my partner.

Aw, geez.

Well, maybe the uniform
makes a big difference.

Who am I to say?

To me, you just look
like a sidekick.

Call me a sidekick
one more time!

- Call me a sidekick!
- Hey, man! Come on! Aw, geez!

Wanna see how I paint a wall?!

It was
the Morty Town Locos, man!

- The -- The Morty Town Locos!
-[ GROANS]

Aah! Aah!

Do you realize how many codes
you just violated?

Aw, geez, Rick.

What do I know about
knowin' stuff?

Get in the fuckin' car.

More lasers.

You could take more time to
answer the question if you like.

Okay, Juggling Rick,

how would you solve
the Citadel's financial crisis?

First off, can I just say
that I believe this Citadel

is the greatest
in the entire multi-verse.

Now, I believe
the answer to your question

has three parts.

First, education spending
must get <i>much</i> higher.

<i>But it has to be balanced
with defense...</i>

- Whoa! <i>Whoa!</i>
- Can we fact-check this please?

Never mind.
Who am I kidding?

This race is over.

And that's how you run
a Citadel!

[ALL RICKS CHEERING]

Candidate Morty, the number
of displaced Mortys is soaring

while Rick satisfaction levels
are plummeting,

and the divide between the two
groups has never been wider.

Solve that one real quick.

[RICKS CHEERING, CHUCKLING]

I don't see a divide
between Ricks and Mortys.

Oh, shocker.

-[ FARTS]
- [LAUGHTER]

I'd like to offer a re-buttal.
[ FARTS ]

Gentlemen, gentlemen, I think
we can all agree on one thing.

[ FARTS TWICE ]
Well, it came out as two things,

but you get the idea.

-[ LAUGHTER]
- You guys finished?

[LAUGHING STOPS]

The division I see is between
the Ricks and Mortys

that like the Citadel divided...

and the rest of us.

I see it everywhere I go.

I see it in our schools

where they teach Mortys
we're all the same,

because they're threatened
by what makes us unique.

I see it in our streets
where they give guns to Mortys

so we're too busy fighting each
other to fight real injustice.

I see it in our factories

where Ricks work for a fraction
of their boss' salary

even though they're identical
and have the same IQ.

<i>The Citadel's problem
isn't homeless Mortys</i>

<i>or outraged Ricks.</i>

[SCREAMS]

[GUNSHOTS]

<i>The Citadel's problem
is the Ricks and Mortys</i>

<i>feeding on the Citadel's death.</i>

- Holy shit.

RICK SECURITY OFFICER:
He's headed for the flavor core!

<i>But I've got
a message for them,</i>

<i>from the Ricks and Mortys
keeping it alive,</i>

a <i>message
from the Ricks and Mortys</i>

that believe in this Citadel

to the Ricks and Mortys
that don't.

You're outnumbered.

[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

Holy shit.

I don't believe it.

L-I can't believe it.

I know.
That's why you're fired.

Sounds like
you're looking for work.

I can offer you a very enticing
compensation package.

First, let's talk benefits.

Daddy loves you.
That's Daddy's good girl.

Your life is a lie, man.

All your life's are lies!
Don't you get it?!

They told us we were special
because we were Ricks,

but they stripped us of
everything that made us unique!

We know how you feel.

We're working-stiff Ricks
just like you.

But our assembly line
is justice.

What are your demands?

I-I-I want a portal gun.

Unregistered, untraceable,

with enough fluid to take me off
this goddamn prison!

- The media's outside.
- Well, keep 'em there.

Anyway, so, yeah, the suspect
says the Citadel's a lie,

built on lies,
and some other shit.

I say appreciate
the life you have,

because it can always be worse.

Back to you, Ricks.

Thank you, Rick 0716-C.

- That fuckin' guy.
- Tell me about it.

[CLEARS THROAT]
Meanwhile, in election news,

an unexpected turn of events
as Morty from the Morty Party

soars to the top of the polls.

- Morty! Morty! Morty!
- Yes.

Morty, what's your original
reality, and where's your Rick?

Gosh, we moved around so much,
it's hard to remember.

I see every Rick as my Rick.

<i>I hope they see me
as their Morty.</i>

Another? Please?
With less water?

Hey, cheer up, pal.

A Morty's gonna be president.

Imagine this kisser
getting blamed for everything.

I guess I should've
had more faith.

It's not faith you need.
It's fear.

What's this?

It's secrets.

Wh-Wh-Wh-What do you
think it is?

Look at how I'm dressed.

my new...R-Rick?

It's okay, Morty.

-[ GRUNTS]
-[ SCREAMS]

[MOBILE PLAYING]

Jesus.

He stabbed me.
He got me bad, Morty.

Shh. It's okay.
You're okay.

You were right.
[COUGHS]

Everything I learned
at the academy was --

Doesn't matter.

Nothing's wrong with putting
your faith in a Morty.

You just gotta pick
the right one.

Why is there a crib in here?

Something they do.
To make you feel bad.

Boy, I got us knee-deep
in paperwork, huh?

<i>Go to the car
and grab a mach-pack.</i>

Let me worry about this.

- What happened?
- Same old story.

Mortys killing Mortys.

Almost...got it.

-[ ALL YELPING]
- FARMER RICK: Hey!

Y'all get the hell away
from my damn mega fruit!

[ALL YELPING]

- Sic 'em, boy!
-[ BARKING ]

I don't wear this dag-nab hat

and commit
to this rural character

so you can eat for free
while you come of age!

I bet the Wishing Portal
leads to a reality

where they're -- where all --

where it's a bunch of
French toast with boobies.

I bet it leads to a place
with a bunch of fry --

fly -- flies everywhere.

Yeah, I bet it goes nowhere.

I bet it's a big hole

where the Citadel dumps
all its broken dreams.

Slick, why do you have to be
so dramatic?

You wanna know why?
Because of this.

I'm part of
an experimental line of Mortys

with a drama implant.

How do you think it feels,
Fat Morty,

to know that
no matter where I go,

I'll always be the one

that makes everybody sad
and a little bored?

Slick, that implant
isn't who you are, okay?

You also roll up your sleeves.

I thought
I was Left-Handed Morty.

Then you should use your left
hand to eat more vegetables.

Hey, there. How you doing?
Great to meet you.

I'm a plumber, sir.
I'm a Rick, and I'm a plumber.

That doesn't sound like
Rick work.

You didn't come to the Citadel
to be a plumber, did you?

Ha! ha!
I sure didn't, sir!

Mr. Morty! Mr. Morty!

I cloned myself so you could
kiss me as a baby!

This is just like a Morty baby!

[ALL CHEERING]

Hey, did you, uh,
end up getting a new job?

Yeah, I did.
Assassinating you.

[GROANS]

[SCREAMS]

I'm okay.
I'm okay.

I'm...

[GROANS]

Aw, man. Aw, geez.
Aw, hah.

You look like you could use
a good time.

One dance for $10, two for $25.

No, thank you.
And bad math.

Ha! Ha! Yeah!
This is a good time!

- What is this place?
- The Creepy Morty.

What is it your kind's
always saying?

"Don't think about it."

Come on. There's someone
important I want you to meet.

Ah, Bubbala!

How'd it go with
the Morty Town Locos?

They had a little accident.

They won't be causing
any trouble anymore.

Those were bad Mortys.
Very bad Mortys.

[SNAPS FINGERS]

Big Morty likes to contribute

to keeping the peace
in Morty Town.

Think of him as a "drug lord"
and us as cops on his payroll.

- Morty...
- TOGETHER: Which Morty?

M-M-My partner.

Morty, you're right.
Morty Town is bad.

But that doesn't mean
that we have to be.

Hey, what's going on here,
Morty?

- TOGETHER: Which Morty?
- The cop, morons!

Don't worry about Rick,
Big Morty.

He's new.

He doesn't understand
how it works.

That's what you said
about your last partner.

Why would you say something
like that, Big Morty?

You're fucking things up
for both of us here.

Wrong. He's fucking things up
for both of you.

Unless he takes the money.

Big Morty, you're under arrest.

S-Smartest man in the universe.

[GRUNTS]

[ALL SHOUTING, GUNFIRE]

They're just props!
Th-They're just props!

-[ GROANS]
- Not so big now, are ya?

I never was!
It was figurative!

That's enough.

If we don't kill him,
he'll talk.

If you do, <i>I'll</i> talk.

O-One thing's for sure.

Y-Y'all don't have to worry
about Cowboy Morty talkin'.

This little cowpoke's gonna
mosey up on out of here.

You told me to put my faith
in the right Morty.

I've got faith in you, partner.

Do the right thing.

Oh, Grandpa Rick,

I-| don't wanna be
on the Citadel anymore.

I wanna be a regular kid.

L-I wanna to go to school
and throw balls around

and masturbate.

[SIRENS WAILING]

What the hell happened in there?

Same old story.

Ricks killing Mortys.

Okay, man, okay,
we got your portal gun.

What the hell's he doing?

-[ GROANS ] Where -- Where am I?
- A bad place.

But you're going
to a better one soon.

Hey! Hey!

- No,no,no,no!
- Whaa--

God damn it!

A portal to
the blender dimension?

That's the oldest trick
in the book!

I'm a Rick!
I'm more Rick than any of you!

Then you should know you just
killed your only leverage!

Then comes and get me,
motherfuckers!

[GUNS COCK]

[BUZZING]

Stop.
I'm Rick D. Sanchez the Third,

owner of this here
wafer establishment,

and I say that the Rick in there
is right.

He's more Rick than any of you.

He's a terrorist!

What Rick isn't?!

The Citadel was founded by Ricks
for Ricks to be free!

What's your name, young man?

- Rick. And I'm --
- The same age as me, I know.

- How long have you worked here?
-15 years.

What the hell have we become?

Whatever time you were gonna
make him serve, he's served it.

It ends now.

- Come with me, friend.
- Where are we going?

To your new life.

Which starts with walking
the fuck out of here.

- Yo J-22, give 'em hell!
-[ BURPS]

[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

SAM ELLIOT: There's a Rick
that held a factory hostage

after murdering his boss
and several co-workers.

The factory made cookies,
flavored them with lies.

He made us all take a look
at what we were doing.

And in the bargain,
he got a taste of real freedom.

[GUNSHOT]

We captured that taste,
and we keep giving it to him

so he can give it
right back to you

in every bite of new Simple Rick
Freedom Wafer Selects.

Come home to the unique flavor

of shattering
the grand illusion.

Come home to Simple Rick.

It is real.

[GRUNTS]

After you.

SPECS: There it is.
The Wishing Portal.

They say for your wish
to come true,

you have to give up something
really important.

For me, that's my panini maker.

I wish for a million sandwiches.

And, yes, I see the irony.

I guess
I wish I had something cooler

than this dumb-ass
surfer necklace.

I wish incest porn had --
had a more mainstream appeal.

For -- For a friend of mine.

None of those things
are gonna happen, you know.

Morty wishes never come true.

Not on the Citadel.

Then why did you bring us here?

Because I wish
that would change.

I wish anything about this life
would change.

Well, I hope you're
putting something

pretty goddamn important
in there.

Me too.

But I doubt it.

- No!
- Slick!

M-Maybe...

Maybe it went somewhere nice.

AUTOMATED RICK:
Garbage dump.

<i>Stand [BURP] back.</i>

He had to be stopped.

He -- He cou-- He c--
couldn't be allowed to win.

Then you should've [BURPS]
worked on your aim, bro.

He's alive? No, no, no.
You gotta listen to me.

L-| worked for him.
I was his campaign manager.

That Morty is not what he seems.

Yeah, well, no Morty
seems like a president.

- He...won?
- Yeah.

It was a blowout.

I would hardly call it
a blowout.

It was almost close enough
to trigger a recount.

Jesus. What are you,
joke security now, too?

RICK COP:
Why am I still here?

I heard he confessed
to everything.

Your case has been reviewed.
You're free to go.

But...I violated at least
a dozen departmental codes.

New department.
New codes.

New Citadel.

SPECS: Did we miss graduation?
Where are the new Ricks?

No graduation.
No new Ricks.

The school's curriculum
is changing.

To what?

I don't know,
and I don't have to know.

I've been fired.

[ BURPING ]
Good luck, turds.

Holy crap.
Slick's wish came true.

Sorry I'm late, Mr. President.

- Had a little crisis at work.
- Worth it!

It's no problem.

Uh, a little more off the top.

You were saying,
Garment District Rick.

We were saying,
"President" Morty,

that we don't care
who sits in that seat.

A Rick, a Morty, a goddamn
Jerry, doesn't matter.

We've been running the Citadel
since before the council,

and you'll find that we're
still running it now.

Does he really speak
for everyone here?

- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah.

Well, I think it's important
to be clear.

Raise your hand
if he speaks for you.

[ALL SCREAMING]

Is...that enough off the top?

I don't know. Is it?

- Yes, yes, goddamn, yes.
- I think it's great.

Good.

This seems like
a good time for a drink

and a cold calculated speech
with sinister overtones.

A speech about politics...

About order...

brotherhood...

power.

But speeches
are for campaigning.

Now is the time for action.

it wasn't a one-off thing

and I can see her again.

By the way, hey, um,
still not curious about

what might've happened
at that crazy Citadel place?

Psh. Not at all, Morty.
That place will never have

any bearing over our lives
ever again.

Unlike that mermaid puss!
Yeah!

We're going back for seconds!

We're gonna do that shit
every week, man!

- That was Atlantis!
- Oh, shit!

﻿Morty, hurry!

Return the Truth Tortoise!

Morty, whatever you do,
don't drop the Truth Tortoise!

Also really important,

whatever you do,
don't look into its eyes!

L-| did look at it, Rick!
I've been looking at it!

Now you're gonna know
everything, Morty!

Good job! Way to go!
You fucked everything up!

[SPEAKING GIBBERISH]

It's in my head!
[SCREAMS]

Ah!

[SCREAMS]

Oh, geez, I-l can't get that
Truth Tortoise out of my head.

Yeah, I told you not
to look into its eyes.

Hey, Morty, let's watch
some interdimensional cable.

Remember how we used to do that?

Rick, I can't -- I can't go on.

L-I can't go on like this

with the Truth Tortoise shit
in my head.

L-| wish you could just --

Erase the memory from your mind?

How did you know
I was gonna say that?

Come on, Morty, come with me.

After you.

What the hell is this?!

This, Morty, is my archive

of all the experiences
you've begged me to remove

from your life,
lest you go insane.

I call them
Morty's Mind Blowers.

And we'll be doing this instead
of interdimensional cable.

[DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYS]

How long have I been asking you
to remove memories?

Since the first [BURPS] time
your mind was blown.

Ahh, here it is.
[BURPS]

Classic.
[ BLOWS]

There's no dust on it because

this isn't the first time
we've done this.

- What?!
- I call this one "Moonspiracy"!

[LAUGHS]

[INSECTS CHIRPING]

MORTY: Huh, wow.
That's incredible.

What the heck?

Morty, do you realize
how ridiculous that sounds?

Yeah, pretty crazy story, Morty.

Are you serious?

Half the crap we've seen,
and you think that sounds crazy?

I've been to 300 versions
of Earth's moon,

including this one,
and I've never seen signs

of a "regular dude,"
as you describe him,

hanging out up there.

It's probably just
a smudge on the lens.

Smudge on the lens?
Smudge on the lens?!

I know the difference between
a man threatening me

and a smudge on
the goddamn lens, Summer!

Morty, calm down!
Are you feeling okay?

I'm fine!

So sensitive.

[SCHOOL BELL RINGS]

PRINCIPAL VAGINA: Kids,
I'd like to introduce you all

to our new guidance counselor,
Mr. Lunas.

I look forward
to helping guide you all

towards a brighter future.

I believe every
student should...

shoot for the moon.

Got you now, you son of a bitch.

[CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKING]

What's this?

Proof that Mr. Lunas
isn't who he says he is!

He's not a guidance counselor?

L-I assume he's qualified
to be one. Who isn't?

But he also lives on the moon.

Okay.

Hmm.
Is that it?

Is he doing anything
to hurt anyone?

Oh, he's up to something.

I think I understand.

"Up to something,"
"lives on the moon."

Okay, I'll talk to him.

[TIRES SCREECHING ]

What did he say?

Denied the moon stuff,
but that's what pedophiles do.

They deny.
It's their bread and butter.

- Pedophile?
- You don't think so?

I thought the moon thing
might have been code.

No, he's literally
from the moon!

Well, you saw him react.

Moon or not,
that dude likes 'em young.

[SIREN WAILS]

Gordon Lunas was a good Marine.

We don't know what drove him
to take his own life,

but we want to remember
the good things.

Like how, from a certain angle,

some people would say
he looked like a smudge.

[SQUEAK]

Oh, my God, what have I done?

What have I done?

Jesus, I made that guy
kill himself!

Only in a literal sense.

Here's one I call
"Morty's [BURPS] Menagerie."

They don't all
have titles, though.

It's not a "Simpsons"
Halloween special,

more like a clip show made
of clips you never saw!

I can't believe we got
put into a menagerie.

So this guy collects
living beings?

RICK: Yeah, you know like
commemorative plates,

but less off-putting.

You'll get it when you're still
actively dating in your 40s.

Assess this with
cold indifference,

you veiny-headed prick!

-[ CRASH! ]
- Hey, keep it down!

Just our luck, menagerie beneath

the "boulder people"
of Granitor Seven.

I can't take it anymore, Rick!

-[ BANGING ]
- Relax, Morty!

I can't relax! R-R-Rick, we --
we gotta get outta here!

I don't care what it takes!
Anything!

- Anything?
- Anything!

All right, well, you're gonna
have to take off your shirt.

Not yet.
I'll tell you when.

[SONAR PINGING]

<i>[CHATTERING]</i>

Dear God.

What?

The signal turned out to be --

there's no other way
to put it --

- Instructions.
- For?

A vehicle, sir,
an interstellar vehicle.

We'll need a pilot.
I wonder if there's a volunteer.

Mm.

Oh, the schematics specify
a second, smaller pilot.

I mean, they really
specify smaller.

They have to be exactly 5'3".

in Liberal Arts,

but I think you're about
to make history.

WOMAN:
Primary systems, check.

Auxiliary systems, check.

See you soon.

Okay, now.

Greetings.

You're --
You look...

We've possessed forms
your mind can accept.

Here are some customary
clothing gifts.

Please, put them on.

- May we?
- Of course, yes.

We followed your instructions.

We have so much
to learn from you.

I know, right?

[CREAK]

Hey, how come I was able to see
those other people's memories?

L-I wouldn't have been
around for that.

Yeah, sometimes I gotta do
a little editing, Morty.

It helps the mind blowers

play a little bit better
upon revisiting.

I call this one
"The Whole Enchilada.

Here, Morty, this'll make
your urine drinkable.

Now can we keep shopping?

I am Zikzak.

Ah, shit, Morty, get behind me.
It's a fucking alien overlord!

It's okay.
Here.

Oh, I misjudged.

MORTY: "I am Floop Floopian.
Please kill me."

That's right, Morty.

The Floop Floopians achieve
an eternal orgasmic afterlife,

so long as they're killed
by a great warrior.

I'm flattered, by the way.
Thank you very much.

So you're gonna kill him?

Eh, let's get some lunch first.

So, you want to get shot
in the head, or --

Well, as long as
the wound is fatal,

I don't really mind
where you shoot me.

Cool.
I'm gonna go take a quick shit.

Well, I gotta say.
You know, I'm a little envious.

Your species has
an actual afterlife.

- That's gotta be nice.
- Wh-What do you mean?

Well, you know, here on Earth,
w-we don't know what's going on.

It must be nice for you guys to,
you know, have that --

have that proof's in
the pudding, you know, evidence.

Evidence?
There's supposed to be evidence?

Um, yeah, uh...

Otherwise,
how do you know if it's true?

[CLEARS THROAT]

to do this here or outside?

I shouldn't have let
you make me doubt it!

Aah!

But he said there
wasn't any evidence!

That was a ton of evidence!

Well, silver lining.

Now I know their
religion's real.

They have a hell,
and it does not look good.

I noticed you never finished
your chimichanga,

so I got some room for it now,
if you know what I mean.

Holy shit!

How many of these are just
horrible mistakes I've made?

I mean, maybe
I'd stop making so many

if I let myself learn from them!

Don't break your back
creating a lesson, Morty.

It's a freeform anthology.

I'm getting annoyed
you're not hearing that.

As you can see around me,
your mind's been blown

countless times,
and not always by yourself.

Ah, shit, I don't even --

This better not
have been a good one.

keep looking?

and the purple ones are my

into it, Morty!

before the sunset, Morty.

a cave over there.

too many movies, Morty.

We're gonna have to use Beebo.

Beebo led us to water!
He's our friend!

- He won't even feel it!
- Oh, no, no!

[BEEBO GROANS]

You wanna die, Morty?
Get in Beebo!

Oh, no, no!

Brace for the ice limit.

Here it comes!

Wait, are we on Venzenulon Nine
or Venzenulon Seven?

Wait a minute. Why would I ask
for that to be removed?

Are the red ones stuff
you wanted removed?

Ooh, that's clever, Morty, but
I don't use color to sort things

because I'm not a mouse in
a European children's book.

Then why are all those
pink ones by the liquor?

Liquor?

[RAY GUNS BLASTING]

[ BOTH SIGH ]

- Shit, that was close.
- We lost Captain Sky.

He gave his life
for the uprising.

Yeah. It really makes
you think, huh, Morty?

We should never take
things for granite.

- What?
- I'm just saying, life's short.

We shouldn't take things
for granite.

- Are you saying "granite"?
- Well, yeah.

It's "granted," with a

Take things for granted.
Did you actually think it was --

[LAUGHS]
Jesus Christ, Rick,

what are you, a boulder --
a rock person?

How long have you been
saying that wrong?

Oh, you like that, huh?

I b-b-bet that really
blows your mind.

I mean, yeah,
it's kind of great.

- You want me to erase it?
- What, you can do that?

-[ BUZZING ]
- Ah, shit.

I fucking knew it,
you piece of shit!

You -- You --
You're a fucking asshole, Rick!

Take it easy, Morty.
Come on. Just relax.

No, I'm not gonna fucking relax!
Come here!

Let go of me, you little bitch!

I'm gonna grab you
by the scruff of your --

- Take that!
- Ohh!

- Umm.
- Umm. Uhh.

- What --
- What's going on?

- Where am I?
- Who are we?

- Who am I?
- I think I'm an adolescent boy.

Huh, and I'm an elderly man.

And we appear to be in some kind
of secret confined space.

- Yeah, umm...
- Don't look at me like that.

For all we know, you could be
the fuckin' weirdo.

Huh, these things are
obviously storage units,

and since we can't remember
what went wrong,

my guess is that the technology
involves memory

and that this thing on your head
is designed to...

Tell us the code, jagoff!

[SPEAKING ALIEN LANGUAGE]

It's pointless.
He's stonewalling.

Rick, if we don't unlock
those vaccines, Earth dies!

You know, it might be time
to step up your interrogation!

Not sure what
you're implying, Morty,

but some lines I don't cross.

Yeah, well,
I crossed every line I had

when this bastard
tried to kill Jessica!

[SPEAKING ALIEN LANGUAGE]

Okay, see those two fleshy sacs
under his chin, Morty?

Grab 'em.

You remember the codes now?

- Twist!
-[ SCREAMING]

Give us the codes, man!
Twist harder, Morty!

- Harder!
-[ SCREAMING]

Okay, let go, let go,
let him breathe.

[SPEAKING ALIEN LANGUAGE]

He wants to make a deal.

Half the codes now,
half after you finish.

But can we trust --
Wait, what?

F-Finish what?

Y-You know.

I thought I was torturing him!

Oh, and this disappoints you?

Do I tell him we don't
have a deal, Morty?

Because if we can
kill our enemies

but we can't jack them off, then
how are we better than them?

Well, what did you find out?

We're partners, I guess,

and we fight aliens,
like "Men in Black"?

"Men in Black," "Men in Black."

I have "Men in Black 2" in here.

So -- So you get
the general idea.

[LAUGHS]
Not quite.

It's basically an endless string
of callbacks to --

All right, save it for YouTube.
I'll keep looking for clues.

What are you doing?

You want your shelf
level or not?

And if I say yes, you're gonna
provide that for me with that?

Yes, see the bubble?

I'm familiar with
the bubble, Morty.

I also dabble in precision,

and if you think
you can even approach it

with your sad, naked,
caveman eyeball

and a bubble of fucking air,
you're the reason this species

is a failure,
and it makes me angry!

You're drunk.

You want to put up a shelf,
put up a shelf.

You want to experience
true level?

- Do you?
-[ SIGHS DRAMATICALLY] Y-yes.

[POWERING UP]

Ugh, all right, come on.

[SIGHS]

Wow, it's so --

Oh, oh, oh, oh, my God, oh,
Christ, ooh, ooh, ooh, ahh.

Oh, yeah, true level, bitch.

Morty, come on,
we're leaving for school.

Oh, everything's crooked!
Reality is poison!

I want to go back!
I hate this!

- What's his deal?
- Can't live like this!

Shh, shh, shh, shh, Morty,
Morty, Morty.

Go to school, Summer.
I'll go in Morty's memory

and do a little --
[CLICKS TONGUE]

Lambs to the cosmic sLAUGHTER!

Well?

You seem to be in charge
of what I get to remember.

- Why?
- Good question.

Morty, I need darkness to prime
these optical inductors.

Hit the leftmost light switch
by the door for me.

The left.

[ CLICK, CLICK, CLICK]

Okay, lights on.

[SIGHS]

So, did I just hear three
distinct light switch clicks?

W-W-What do you mean?

I feel like the three sounds
I heard could be explained

by an initial erroneous flipping
of a switch on the right

followed by a hasty,
corrective flipping

of the requested switch.

Then during the resultant
darkness and silence, a third,

shameful unflipping of
the initially flipped switch.

Is my assessment accurate?

Yeah, that's -- that's basically
how -- how it all shaked out.

- I'm sorry.
- Ugh. All right, come on.

- What?!
- Come on!

[HIGH-PITCHED TONE]

-[ CLICK, TONE ENDS]
- Grab a shovel.

W-What is --

Grab a shovel!

[CLICK]

What was that?

I can't find a goddamn
zip tie anywhere!

All right, fuck it!

[ BEEPING ]

[MAGNETIZING]

Ahh, zip tie.

[ POWERING DOWN]

[ BEEPING ]

[MAGNETIZING]

[WOMEN SCREAMING]

Why are you making me
do this for you again?

Who doesn't wish they could
talk to animals, Rick?

Most humans!

There, I'm done.
Just stay out of trouble!

Gotta keep moving.
Can't stop.

Up, down, down, up, up, up,
down, up, stop, down.

The queen needs food.
The babies need food.

The queen makes babies.

MALE VOICE:
The situation in Argentina

has proven less convenient
than predicted.

We'll have to re-destabilize
their economy,

refocus labor class outrage
from upper to middle,

foster a coup, and install
a compliant regime.

MALE SQUIRREL:
Same as Guatemala?

Yes, but you can double-time it.

We need a quorum
to pick a new pope

in case the Exxon/Monsanto thing
falls through in Africa.

Why not use chemtrails?
Put a canopy on Uganda.

They're set to agitate
any mo-- What?

That kid is watching us.

So, we're squirrels.
He's a kid.

He's watching us like he hears
what we're saying.

Hey, kid. Young man?
Come here, little boy.

Tell Daphne to run a on a possible Dolittle.

Little boy! We'll give you
wishes if you can hear us!

We can make you fly
and get candy.

[SQUIRRELS CHITTERING]

[WHISTLING]

Oh, fuck! Oh, fuck!
Fuck me! Fuck me!

[PANTING] Rick!

RICK: Ah, shit, Morty,
what did you do?

[POWERING UP]

-[ ZAP!]
-[ SQUIRRELS SCREECHING]

All right, Morty,
pack your shit!

That's only gonna keep 'em down
for a little bit, Morty!

You fucked with
squirrels, Morty!

We got a good five minutes

before they're backing up
on our ass, Morty!

We have to pack up and move
to a new reality, Morty!

You know I said we could
only do that a couple of times!

We're fucked over here because
of these damn squirrels, Morty!

I don't know what
my reaction is,

but I think I'm mounting
in suspicion of you.

- Well, what are you gonna do?
- I'm gonna remember everything!

Everything!

-[ SCREAMS]
-[LAUGHS]

[SCREAMS]

-[ FARTS]
-[LAUGHS]

Yeah!

Ow!

Ah!

Ow!

[CRYING]

Well, what'd you find out?

Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, what
are you gonna do, kill me?

No, I'm not gonna kill you.
I'm gonna kill myself!

All those memories just erased!

Sitting in this room
collecting dust!

W-What's the point of going on
if most of everything

that happens just ends up
sitting in here?

All right, kid.

I don't know much aside from
the fact that "Men in Black 2"

was a joyless cash grab, but I
do know that whatever you have

brewing around in your noggin
really connected with you.

I can't deny that,

and I can't deny that I'm
inspired by your passion.

I want in.
Suicide pact!

-[ RAY GUN POWERS UP]
- Yes, yeah, let's do it!

Together, you old
son of a bitch! On three!

One...

Two...

You guys doing
Morty's Mind Blowers?

Morty's Mind Blowers?

[SIGHS ] Grandpa,
is this a scenario three?

Uh, w-what's that,
and w-who are you?

Oh, man, it's a scenario four.

-[ SPITS]
-[ DART GUN SHOOTING]

Ugh, fucking God damn it!

I don't get paid enough
for this shit!

<i>There's a Craftsman nearby.
I can smell it.</i>

Whoa, what -- what --

<i>Can I help you?</i>

H-How did we fall asleep during
interdimensional cable?

- Yeah, what the hell, Summer?
- Summer, you dumb bitch!

How long were we out,
you dumb bitch!

How much interdimensional cable
did we miss, you stupid bitch!

How many improv TV shows with
commercials did we miss, Summer?

Why did you let us fall asleep?

- You dumb bitch!
- You stupid bitch!

All right, Morty,
fuck this noise.

Let's get out of here
and go on a classic

- Rick and Morty adventure.
- Yeah, right, Rick, I'm all-in.

No wonder you're
constantly fighting

with each other
and behind schedule.

- What?
- Nothing.

[ROCK MUSIC PLAYS]

Rick?
Hello?

Just here for my putter.

Jerry's Mind Blowers?

Follow the boys!

We're charged and aimed
at Alpha Centauri,

ready for transport.

They fell for it!
Let's send Gobo home!

-[ LAUGHTER]
- All right!

- Where's Dad?
- He should be here any second.

It's funny, Jerry spent his life
seeking attention,

but in the end, humanity's
instinctive dismissal of him

saved an alien's life.

He knows where to go, right?

Yep, any minute now.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

Did it work?
Did you guys get Gobo home?

You have Gobo! You were supposed
to bring him to the hill!

As if.
He was in your basket.

He was in your car!

[CHEWING]

Oh!

Oof!
Dibs on his stuff.

Oh, shit,
I almost parked.

Hey, Morty, hold on,
wat-watch this.

Uh-huh.

Well,
I thought it was cool.

So.
We should be in and out.

Simple exchange,
not even really an adventure.

And if anything goes wrong --
which it won't --

jump into the same vat of acid
I jump into.

Okay.
Wait -- Wait, what?

Wha-What vat of acid?What, Morty!

Close the door.

I pre-scouted
this location

and placed a vat of fake acid
amongst the real ones.

It's got air hoses

and a compartment of bones
at the bottom.

If things go wrong,
which they won't,

we jump into
the vat of acid,

and I'll release the bones,
they'll float up --

What is this face
you're making?

Aren't you an inventor?

Yeah, what part of a fake acid
vat with built-in air supply

and quick-release bones
isn't inventive enough for you,

and when did my job become
pitching you ideas?

Alright!
Let's just do this.

I have English homework.You're still
learning English?

That's the language
you speak.

How dumb are you?

Interesting choice
of meeting place, Rick.

You like it?
My grandson had notes.

- Come on.
- Show him the crystals, Morty.

I'll make lots of money
with these.

I'll make lots of those
with these.Well. Those are fake.

- Oh, Jesus fucking Christ. Come on.
- You gotta be kidding me. Seriously?

You brought fake crystals
anda gun?

Beats real crystals
and no gun.

Okay, but does anything beat
fake crystals and a fake arm?

Whoa,
do you know who I am?!

Even if you kill me,
you're a dead man.

Are you serious?

Morty, he's right.
We're screwed.

Let's just end it.
Quick death, come on.

Aw, man. Oh!

Eh!

Holy shit, what the fuck?

Holy shit.

What kind of psycho...?

His own grandson?

Guess he took
your threat pretty serious.

Yeah, but it just...

doesn't make any sense.

Well,
he was a scientist.

Maybe he knew more
about acid,

maybe it's like
the most painless way to go.

How could that
have been painless?

You saw that pause
before the bones floated up,

that had to be five seconds
of unparalleled torture.

I...
I can't get my head around it.

I-I thought I'd seen
this galaxy at its darkest.

This is -- This is gonna take
a while to feel normal.

We're pretty good listeners,
boss.

Drinks are on us
if you want to talk it out.

Thanks, but...

what happened,
it happened here.

I don't want
to lose the moment.

Take your time, boss.

We'll stay here
as long as you want.

Absolutely.
I got nowhere to be.

And then
little Tommy FlimFlam's

running down
the Hyperloop.

His ass is on fire
from Xenon fluid,

but his AI hologram
is fuckin' his own pee hole.

Great story, boss.
Really detailed.

Yeah, well,
I got a million of 'em.

Alright.

I think I'm ready
to deal with the world now.

Let's get out of here.

Should we drop our buddy
in here before we go?

Yeah,
probably a good idea.

Should we use
a different vat?

Does acid lose its acid power
the more it dissolves?

What am I,
an acidologist?

Here, grab that
ratlike creature,

we'll do a little test.

Look, if you're going to test
the damn acid, don't use a rat,

take that ladle,
grab a spoonful,

and put it in the analyzer.

- Oh! - Hey!
- Oh!

Okay, I'd say that's
pretty acidy. Drop him in.

What are you doing?

You said -- Not the rat!

The guy!

Ooh! Marone!

Look at the size
of the bones on that rat!

Oh!

How many sets of bones
this rat got?

And look how
the smaller ones are shaped!

They're like little
cartoon bones,

like if you drew a bone
in art class!

Alright,
that tears it.

I'm canceling
the rest of my night

and calling a bone scientist.

We're getting to the bottom
of this --

Jesus fucking Christ,
enough already!

- Oh! - Hey!
- Whoa!

Can we go?

The fuck
is wrong with you?

Just admit
it was a shitty idea!

Having a grandson?

A vat of fake acid!

Are you dying
of dementia?

How are you talking to me
like this?

Wh-When did you get
so cocky?

Tonight!
Tonight, Rick!

The night
I saw you fail!

Because you ruined it!It was pre-ruined!

Oh, was it worse than
when I was a pickle?

Oh-oh-oh that's right,
you weren't there for that.

Turned out
kind of cool.

Maybe there's
a connection there.Excuse me?

What's that cool thing
you did without me again?

The awesome thing?

I-I-I guess
you wanted a dragon?

Mwah. Unforgettable.

God, fuck you.

Timely, too,
you really got in on that

"Game of Thrones" fever
right at the peak.

You trying as hard
as you can to hurt me right now

proves my point.

I'll let you know
when you have a point

and the world will know
when I try to hurt you.

Big man, big genius.
Big lonely drunk.

Hey, save some of these
atomic-age beatnik zingers

for your
English homework, Bukowski.

There's no such thing
as a bad idea, Morty.

It's about execution.

No such thing
as a bad idea?

Except all of mine,
right?

Morty, wanting a dragon
isn't an idea.

I'm not talking
about that!

I'm constantly pitching you
ideas, Rick,

and you act like they're
not even worth thinking about!

What,
the helicopter lawn chair?

That's just something
you saw on TV.

What about my video-game-style
place-saving device?

Oh, my God,
here we go.

It's a good idea, Rick!
A device that lets you --

Save your place
like in a video game

but in real life
so that you can try stuff

and then go back
to your save point,

yes, Morty,
I saw it on "Futurama."

Oh, so you don't do anything
unless it's original?

I don't do
time travel.

It's not time travel,
it's saving a place in time --

Oh, my God,
is this what you think I do?

This is where the heavy lifting
happens in your mind?

Do you have any idea
how much fucking work

would have to go into
a machine that --

Ah-ha!
You can't do it!

I can do anything,
Morty.

Your idea
is not worth doing.

You can't do it.

Before what you're trying to do
was called "negging,"

it was called
"reverse psychology,"

and incels didn't invent it,
Bugs Bunny did.

You can't do it.There is nothing
I cannot do.

A place-saving
video-game thing!You're a piece of shit!

- Just say you can't do it!
- I won't!

You won't say
you can't?

Fuck you, Morty!Fuck you!

Fuck you!

Son of a bitch.

So are you gonna --Yes,
I'm gonna fucking do it!

Rick, it's 3:00 a.m.

Wh-Wh-What's going on?
W-Why'd you call me?

You were right, Morty.

I failed.
I can't make it.

And honestly,
I'm pretty ashamed.

That might be why I've been
so aggressive and unfair

about rejecting
your ideas.

- Rick...
- A fake acid vat, Morty?

Maybe I've lost it.
Maybe I never had it.

Hey. C'mon. Y-You know
I didn't mean it that way.

I just think we need to find
better ways to communicate.

I'm sorry. I just...
I lash out sometimes.

I-I-I don't know why I do that!
I'm so ashamed of myself.

Hearing you talk about
the vat...

it really
opened my eyes.

- Like what the fuck am I even doing?
- Hey, hey.

I don't like hearing this talk.
You're a great inventor.

We just got a couple things
to work on.

Let's start with inventing
a little honesty.

Sound good?Thank you, Morty.
Sounds good.

- Or maybe I'll just kill you.
- What?

Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, Rick --

Because I fucking did it!Oh-ho-ho!

Booya!
Holy shit!

You did it!
You did it!

I did it,
you little son of a bitch!

How did you --Morty,
do you want me to explain,

or you wanna
go have some fun?I wanna have some fun!

Oh, my God.

Rick, this is --
this is -- thank you!

You can thank me later.
Go nuts.

Best grandpa ever!

That's all I ever wanted
to hear.

Alright, class,

I know I've been absent
for most of this school year.

I'll be honest with you --
during spring break,

I attended
a renaissance faire

and fell in love with a buxom
hand-axe juggler half my age.

I overplayed my interest
in her lifestyle

just to get closer to her,

traveling the country
with her troupe,

and I am embarrassed to say
I am now an expert blacksmith

with several STDs
and a broken heart.

I beseech your nasty
little asses

to speak on the matter
no further.

Now that that's out of the way,
who wants to do some math?

I'll do it.A bold move,
Morty Smith.

But can you deliver?

Oh, I've got something
to deliver.

Ahh!
Oh, God.

What the hell!

Aw, goddamnit,
this is traumatizing.

Oh, my God, what's wrong
with your dick?

Not cool.
I'm allergic to sheepskin!

Bold move, Morty Smith.
But can you deliver?

Holy shit.
I can do anything.

Yes, with math,
anything is possible.

Except a long-term relationship
with a woman

that calls you a warlock
for using a phone.

Hi, uh, hey, Jessica.

Oh.
Hey, Morty.

Hey...
Jessica, right?

Um. Yeah.
Hi. Sorry.

I thought
you knew my name

because we've interacted
so many times,

but maybe I was
just being stupid.

Sorry. Hi.
I-I'm Jessica. That's me.

Cool.
See you around.

Jessica. Yeah.
I hope I see you.

Around.
Guess we'll see.

I think I'm gonna
like this thing.

Hey, I'm sorry I brushed you off
the other day.

I was just
trying to be cool --

Oh, I don't even know
what you're talking about.

But...
you seem different.

Like you finally
found yourself.

Yeah.
I -- I guess I have.

That's good to hear.
I like who you found.

Yeah.
Yeah, I do, too.

Looking forward
to seeing more.

I'll see you tomorrow,
Morty.

Yeah.
Yeah, I'll see you tomorrow.

How's it going?

Y'know, it was fun, Rick.
Real fun.

Y'know I-I-I definitely
sowed those oats.

But I think you invented

a little lesson for me
along the way.

Living without
consequences is great,

but then I started
wondering...

what am I living for?

What am I building?

If I'm always looking back,
I'm never looking ahead.

And then it hit me.

We are who we are
because of consequences.

You can't live
without consequences, y'know?

You feel me?

Wow.

That's a beautiful thought,
Morty, but, uh, no.

There were definitely
consequences.

What're-What-What are you
talking about?

I mean.
You did everything you did.

It all happened.

No.
But the -- the respawn button.

The -- The do-over.It's not a do-over.

You just did it.
Over and over.

What are you saying?
W-What did you do?

I think it's more appropriate
to ask what did youdo?

You see, Morty, you weren't
saving your place

and going back.

I don't respect
time travel.

If "Ant Man and the Wasp"
can do it, I'm not interested.

It wasn't
so much a do-over

as it was isolating
a moment in time,

splitting your
probable selves,

and shunting you into
to into a near-duplicate,

equally probable reality,
transporting you into it

at the moment
of parallel determination.

Pretty nifty. Time crystals
are a bitch and a half,

but the only real hitch is that
there was already a you

in each
probable dimension.

So we had to solve
for that.

That's right,
you little bitch!

It's "The Prestige"!
You "Prestige'd" yourself!

Rick,
how many did I kill?You tell me, Morty.

Every time you reset
to smell Jessica's hair,

every time you relived
a satisfying fart,

that's how many Mortys
you've incinerated,

you greedy
little junkie.

Oh, God --
even those times when I --

Especially those times.

It's over, Morty. Feel this.

Take this in.
This is God.

Wh-Wh-Wh-Wh --
Why would you do this?

My hands are clean, Morty.
I gave you a choice.

You could
listen to me explain,

in great scientific detail,
how it all works...

or you could have fun.

Did you have fun,
Morty?

Is this
because of the vat?

No.
I'm sorry.

I'm afraid it's too late
for that, Morty.

What's done is done,
but it can end.

The original split
is still timestamped.

I can make it so those Mortys
never existed at all,

make them
purely theoretical.

Oh, God.
What do I do?

I think it's clear
you've done enough.

Tell me how, Rick!
Tell me how I save those Mortys!

You live
with the consequences.

Those things
happened somewhere,

but you can merge
the probable realities

so that only one Morty
did them.

Just do it.

Alright, lemme just
sync these up

and get you back
to your dimension.

Wait, so -- so you're not even
my Rick?

Then -- Then why do you know
about the vat?

Every Rick has a vat!

Well, Morty, I'd say

we've invented
a little honesty today.

How about you?I don't deserve this.

I was just having fun.

So was Jeffrey Dahmer.

Speaking of,
time to pay the piper.

Morty Smith.

Come out with your hands up,
you sick fuck.

We're also fine
with just shooting you

if you wanna
suicide by cop.

What?
What is this?

Wow.
Looks like a SWAT Team,

some drug dealers,

some grassroots MeToo activists,
the ACLU --

Jesus, Morty,
the AARP?

I don't wanna
talk about it!The NAACP, GamerGate...

Morty, is that Supreme Court
Justice Sonia Sotomayor?

I'm sorry!
I -- I'm sorry!

I-Is that
what you want me to say?

What -- What do I do?Oof, well, I'm stumped.

Seems like there's no way
out of this one.

Unless...

God damn it.

Yeah, I guess it is, uh --
what did you call it?

Uh, uh,
"A shitty idea"?

God damn it.Say the vat is good.

The vat is good.

Kiss the vat.

Do not
go into that vat.

It appears to be
full of acid.

It is!
Please, he's just a little boy!

Let me talk to him.Tell him
we're very upset!

Morty, please.
Step back.

That vat
is full of acid.

It'll melt you completely,
leaving only your bones.

- Goddamn it!
- I'm sorry, what did you say?

I'm going in the vat!

Oh! God!
Aw, I blame myself!

Oh, what a tragedy.

This --
Oh, well, he's bones now.

I guess all debts are paid.

Agreed.
He's definitely dead.

Why else
would the bones come up?

While his actions
were horrifying

and we are well within
our rights to be outraged,

I do wonder if we bear
some responsibility

for this young man
melting himself in acid.

Are we here for justice...
or something else?

"Though justice be thy plea,
consider this,

that in the course
of justice...

none of us
should see salvation.

We do pray for mercy."

"Merchant of Venice,"
nice.

Very cool.
Lots to think about.

Vengeance is a tomb,
all-encompassing --

Alright, okay, this isn't a
poetry reading, a kid just died.

Every -- Everybody go home and
hug your loved one or something.

Wait.

How do we know
that's really acid

and you didn't just have
someone's bones in there?

I mean, if you're doubting
if that's really acid

and not just jacuzzi-heated
Mountain Dew,

you're welcome
to use this ladle.

You think
I'm a goddamn idiot?

Brought my own.

Aah!

Oh, God!
Oh, God no!

Oh, God, no!
Oh, no -- Huh?

I'm acid-proof!

Fuck all of you,
fuck all of you,

I'm gonna be rich!

Here's my ass.

Take a good look,
spank it!

Acid proof!

Feels like that guy
had other stuff going on.

Don't ever
make fun of me again.

Ever!

Alright, c'mon Morty,
let's go home.

Wait, what?
This -- This isn't our reality?

What, you think
I'd waste our home

teaching you
a fucking lesson?

I am gonna miss
this place, though --

Johnny Carson's still alive
and on the air,

9/11 never happened,

and Rocky Road ice cream
has peanut butter

instead of marshmallows.The fu-- What?

The marshmallows
are the best part!

Morty...

Our next guest, ah, gave us,

well, actually,
very little information,

ah, besides the fact that he is,
uh, impervious to acid.

So here he is,
he's here to prove it.

Let's welcome this guy.

Let's do this shit!

Now, you're, uh --
you're sure about this?

Eat my ass!
Hoist me!

I did not know that ass
was on the menu.

Don't steal my moment!
Do it!

Ah, okay, then without
further ado -- drop him.

Oh, yeah!
Oh, yeah!

Oh, yeah!
Oh, yeah, oh, yeah!

Looks like I'll be
eating ass flambé.

Please kill me.

﻿[ VACUUM RUNNING ]

Hurry up, Morty.

Grandpa's about
to un-freeze time.

You really should be cleaning
from top to bottom.

I know how to vacuum mom
and dad, Summer.

I've been doing it
for six months.

Then you've been doing it
wrong for six months.

Oh, my god, is that mildew?

It's not my fault we froze
time on a humid day.

You have dropped
so many balls, man.

Do you ever get scared
Grandpa Rick

might make me his new sidekick?

What?!
What kind of monster are you?

A competent one.

Who cares about the [BURPS]
things you guys are

talking about?

[ BURPS ] the whole point
of freezing time was to

stop giving a fuck.
Put a shirt on your dumb dad,

and let's get
this dumb universe rolling.

Let's do this thing.

All right, listen, you two.

We froze time
for a pretty long time,

so when I un-freeze it,

the world's time
is gonna be fine,

but our time's
gonna need a little time

to, you know, stabilize.

Our time is gonna be unstable?

What does that even mean?

It means relax
and stop being a pussy, Morty.

Uh, I thought
you learned that by now.

It also means
don't touch your parents,

or we could shatter into
countless theoretical shards.

- Wait a minute, what?
- And away we go!

[ DEVICE WARBLES ]

♪♪

Um... did we ever put
that mattress under Mr. Benson?

- Shhh.
- Shush, Morty.

A thing or two about...
Wait, what?

Was the house...
When we pulled up,

I could have sworn the house
was completely trashed.

Negative visualization, Jerry.

Explains a lot
about where you're at.

- Hi, sweetie.
- Hi, dad.

Summer, Morty, are you okay?

We... we just missed you a lot.

Yeah, we missed you so much.

Too much to hug you, though.

Yeah, it would
literally destroy them.

Now, listen, why don't...
Why don't... wh-why don't...

Why don't you guys go
get a free Sunday ice cream?

Get out there
and get some ice creams.

Here's $500 cash
in unmarked monies.

I'm just gonna put it
on the floor

and kick it on over to ya.

- You guys go nuts.
- This better not be a bribe.

If I find a single thing
out of place in this house,

my love of ice cream
won't save you.

I'll get my jacket.

Sweetie, is your shirt
on backwards?

[ ALL GASP ]

Yeah. I like it this way.

I'm not stupid.

it was Summer's job

to put the mattress under...

Uh, what?
It was your job, Morty.

- Nuh-uh!
- Yuh-huh!

Actually, sorry, Summer.

I got to back the "M" bomb
on this one.

of you guys uncertain
about anything just now?

Oh, man, I don't feel good.

- Am I me?

- I think so.
- Wait, who said that?

All right,
both of you just don't move.

Don't speak, don't think.
I have to check something.

- What'd you do, Morty?
- I'm gonna help grandpa.

I'll see if he needs help.

What do you mean you're
gonna help him?

[ SCOFFS ] I can help, too.

- What's happening, Grandpa?
- What's going on, Rick?

Sh-sh-shut up.

Oh, crap, are you kidding me?
Two dots?

This never needs to be
more than one dot.

The two of you made us
uncertain!

- What are you talking about?
- What's that mean?

- English, please.
- English?

Our time is fractured...
You two somehow created

a feedback look of uncertainty
that split our reality

into two equally possible
impossibilities.

W-we're exactly like a man
capable of sustaining

a platonic friendship with
an attractive female co-worker.

We're entirely hypothetical.

But I thought there were
infinite time lines?

We're not
on any time line, dummy.

Look. [ CAT MEOWS ]

Oh, my god!

SUMMER: Are those cats?

I assume
they're Schrodinger's cats.

Or, actually, I assume

they both are and aren't,
just like us.

- Is the world gone?
- Is the world gone?

- Where are mom and dad?
- What about mom and dad?

Mom and dad? Get your head
out of your family's ass.

The three of us are lost
in a timeless oblivion.

Your parents get to exist.

They're probably living it up
in some pointless,

grounded story
about their shitty marriage.

Cold stone creamery is the best.

What should we do
with our remaining $20?

You realize they sing
no matter how much you tip?

- Whoa!
- Aaah!

Holy shit.

- What happened?
- I hit a deer.

We... we have to tell
the cops you were driving.

- What?
- This is rum raisin!

It's still alive.

Well, do we... do I, uh,
get, uh, a big rock, or...?

It's not an armadillo, asshole.

I thought that's what
a man's supposed to say.

It's not like
I could've actually done it.

If we were near a hospital,
I could treat it,

but I...
I think we have to just...

It's okay. This is
just something that happens.

And even if we were
in a hospital, what could we do?

You're a horse surgeon,
not a deer surgeon.

So...?

Well, don't different animals...

require different levels
of skill to keep alive?

Oh, god.
Get the deer in the car, Jerry.

Yes, Beth.

This is why you
don't freeze time, you guys.

It's incredibly irresponsible.

And you did it so we could clean
the house after a party?

Look, there's no time
to hold me accountable, Morty.

Like, literally no time.
Look around.

Uncertainty
is inherently unsustainable.

Eventually, everything
either is or isn't.

And we've got about
four hours to be "Is."

- Or...?
- We isn't.

All right, since this time
crystal exists in both

possibilities,

and since it's impossible
that I didn't nail this,

I'm probably about
to press this button

in both possibilities
at exactly the same time.

- How do you know...
- How do you know that...

Whatever your asking me,
the answer is I'm amazing.

And away we go.

Huh, what do you know.
It's working.

- Ow, ow, ow!
- Oh shit.

What the hell
is wrong with you two?

I-I-I-I mean you four!

BOTH:
That hurt! That was painful.

Good, I'm glad it was painful.
You deserve it.

I saw you. Y-you're both [BURPS]
all over the damn place.

We've been split for
20 minutes and your lives

are already scattered
to the quantum fucking wind?

What the hell do
either of you two

have to be so uncertain about?
Your brand of zit cream?

Which chair to sit in
while I do everything?

Come on, spit it out!

Well, you don't exactly
make it easy, Rick.

You make fun of me
all the time...

You're always picking on me...
and now Summer's doing it.

And now you got Summer
to kiss your ass.

Me?! What about you?

You're just as mean to me
because you're jealous...

could you get more excited
to see me fail?

Because you want grandpa
all to yourself!

All right, all right, cool it.
I see what's happening here.

You're both young,
you're both unsure

about your place
in the universe,

and you both want
to be Grandpa's favorite.

I can fix this. Morty, sit here.

Summer, you sit here.
Now, listen.

I know the two of you
are very different

from each other
in a lot of ways,

but you have to understand

that as far
as Grandpa's concerned,

you're both pieces
of shit. Yeah.

I can prove it mathematically.

Actually, l-l-let me
grab my white board.

This has been
a long time coming, anyway.

[ TIRES SCREECH ]

Emergency!
Wounded deer coming in.

[ AIR HISSING ]
- Three.

Excuse me,
you can't be back here.

I'm a certified horse surgeon,

and this deer
needs medical attention.

- Nurse, please move that snake.
- That's my nurse.

And as a horse surgeon,
I'm sure that you know

that deer have much smaller,
much more intricate organs.

As a vet, I'm sure you know
that a deer

is closer to a horse
than you are to a doctor.

So let's save the measuring
for when our dicks are out.

- It's time to save a life!
- Geez.

[ GRUNTS, SIGHS ]

That's odd. This deer's wounded.

Uh, yeah, I was there.
You don't have to rub it in.

I mean it's been shot
with a gun.

MAN: My gun.

May I help you, sir?

No, but you can stop
helping this deer.

I shot it before these two
hit it with their car,

and I followed them
when they hauled it off.

This deer belongs to me.

[ SIGHS ] We don't have
time for this, okay?

I need anaesthetic
and deer saline.

Look, I don't know what
the law says about this,

but I took an oath that I would
let no animal come to harm.

Except when sterilizing,
aborting, or euthanizing them,

or also when eating them
at also any meal.

I'm calling my lawyer.

I hope for all our sakes
you're as bad a surgeon

as I am a hunter.

In your dreams, bitch. Scalpel.

So, in conclusion,
you're both equally mercurial,

overly sensitive, clingy,

hysterical,
bird-brained homunculi.

And I honestly can't even tell
the two of you apart

half the time

because I don't go
by height or age,

I go by amount
of pain in my ass,

which makes you both identical.

All right, everything resolved?

Everybody nice and certain about
their position in my world.

BOTH: - Yes.

All right, perfect. Sit still.

[ BURPS ] arms down.
I'm gonna do this again.

This time be like Grandpa.

You mean drunk?

What's that?
You got something to say?

- No.
- And away we go!

And away we go!

- Huh, that's weird.
- Huh, that's weird.

[ BUTTON CLICKING ]

- Oh, my god.
- What?

The son of a bitch
is gonna kill me!

What?!

The son of a bitch
is gonna kill me!

What?!

Diabolical, unfeeling sociopath.

- Don't you get it?!
- Don't you get it?!

The other Rick isn't trying
to merge us anymore.

He thinks
he can save his own skin

by using the crystal to kill me.

He probably figures
it's [BELCHES] easier

to eliminate one
of the possibilities

rather than merge them.

[ LAUGHS ] I have to admit,

it was always in the back
of my mind, too.

The difference is
I would never do it, until now.

Rick, what the hell
are you doing?

Saving our lives!

After he takes me out, he's...
He's gonna be coming for you.

- Who?
- Me!

[ GUNSHOT ]
- Aah!

- Whoa!
- You see that? Get down!

I told you, he's a psycho.
He's lost it!

Th-th-th-the time fracture
must have made him crazy!

- I don't know what to do!
- Oh, crap!

I don't know what to do!
[ RUMBLING ]

[ DEVICE BEEPS ]

Oh, god,
now there's three of them.

We're outnumbered.
Get in the cupboards.

Wait, don't... don't do that.

They'll know. Wait, wait.

Think about getting in
the cupboards, but don't really.

[ GUNSHOTS ] 
[ SCREAMS ]

Is this what you want,
you sick fuck?!

You want to see children die?!

You son of a bitch.

You don't stop living
until I say so!

Michael.

- Who's this now?
- My lawyer.

I'm here to notify you, ma'am,
that in this county,

any deer shot by a hunter

is that hunter's property
regardless of how far it runs

or who intercepts it
before it dies.

It's called Brad's law.

We can't make you
stop the surgery,

but at this point,
you're performing it on venison.

Actually,
I've decided not to eat it.

All this fear and conflict...
I'm sure it's ruined the meat.

I'm just gonna use the head
for my rec-room wall.

She normally works on horses.

Jerry, if you're not gonna help,
get the fuck out of here.

I will reach into heaven

and yank your screaming
deer soul back!

Jesus.

Shh, shh!

I know where you are,
you creepy old monster.

I know how you think.

Oh, is there where
you think I'm going?

You think I'm standing here?

Well, maybe you're right.

[ MORTY GRUNTS ] 
[ RICK GROANS ]

SUMMER: Holy shit. Now what?

Well, if all of me
knocked out all the Ricks,

and you peed
in all of your pants,

doesn't that mean
that we're all synchronized?

- Right.
- Okay.

So, from now on, whatever we do,
we have to be certain.

Right.

I think I'm certain
we're effed in the "A."

Oh, god, my head.

[ GROANS ] What did you guys do?

We put you in a dog crate
because you were acting crazy

and you caused
another time fracture.

You tried to kill yourself.

O-only in self-defense.

Myself tried to kill me first.

Guys, I don't expect you
to understand this,

but time breaking twice
means our problem is

two times bigger and we've got
half as much time to solve it.

Well, actually, I do expect
you to understand that.

It's basic math. C-can somebody
just let me out of here?

If I die in a cage,
I lose a bet.

Well, is there some way
you can prove

you're not a threat to yourself
and others anymore?

Oh, for god's sake.
All right, here.

- Give me the time crystal.
- Wh-what are you doing?

Calling myself. Here, listen.

It'll [BURPS] probably go
to voicemail

since, you know,
I'm calling myself.

Hello, Rick here.

Don't fall for it. It's a bit.

Just kidding! Ha, ha!

You just got Ricked.

You've reached Rick's voicemail.

You know what to do. [ BEEP]

Hey, Rick. It's Rick.

Listen, I'm sorry about earlier.
No hard feelings.

I know you know I mean it, too.
Take it easy.

Whoa, damn! Look at this.

I'm blowing up...
Three new voicemails.

Hey, Rick. It's Rick.

Listen, I'm sorry about earlier.

Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I heard this one.

Hey, Rick. It's Rick.

Hey, Rick, it's...
You get the idea.

[ BURPS ] W-we're cool now.

Okay, well, we're still not
gonna let you out of this crate.

Fine. I'll just do it myself.

If you could get out that whole
time, why didn't you?

Because I waited
until I was certain

it was what I wanted
to do, Morty.

That's the difference
between you and me.

I'm certain, and you're

a walking burlap sack
filled with turds.

You know, geez, Rick!

Y-y-you're really tearing
into me right now.

You know, words hurt.

- Holy!
- A monster!

Hey, you... Hey, quit yelling.

Quit yelling. What the fuck

your time is all
ripped up to hell!

[ WARBLES ]
You broke your time twice.

- [ SIGHS ]
- How did this happen?

[ ALL SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY ]

Nevermind. Shut the fuck up.
Goddamn.

I'm from the fourth dimension.

I can hear all of y'all.

Now let's just see what we
got here for a second.

- [ GROANS ]
- Goddamn it.

Were you trying
to use this to...

Oh, see, you broke time,
and you thought you could

just stick it back
together with this?

How you think
you gonna move time

while you're standing in it,

you dumbass three-dimensional
monkey-ass dummies?

Oh, way to go, Rick.

Yeah, Grandpa, way to go.

What, you're just gonna listen
to this guy now?

He's got a giant testicle
for a head.

He came here in a bubble.

For all we know, he could be

the David Berkowitz
of Nutsackland.

Shut up. Here, put these on.

They'll sync
your possibilities up

so I can bring you back
to certain time.

Y'all are just...
Just... just negligent.

See, now... now look right here.

Hey, hey, hey, the three of you,
put your collars on.

- We have them on.
- What are you talking about?

- Uh, we did.
- We're not wearing collars.

Exactly.
'Cause you're being obstinate.

[ BELCHES ] What?

Put the damn collars on
if you want to live.

- They're on right now.
- We did. They're on.

All right, fine.
Summer, Morty, put them on.

[ DEVICE BEEPS ]

[ WARBLING ]

- Yes, we're back!
- No more cats!

- We're back in certain time.
- Problem solved.

No more cats! Oh, you did it!

- You fixed it.
- Yeah, I did.

Now keep those collars on so you

don't break
your weak-ass time again.

How long, exactly, do we have
to wear these things?

They're really embarrassing.

Well, since you're going
to time prison,

I'd say you can
keep them on forever.

- Time prison?
- Yeah.

Well, I don't know where you
expect me to think

you got that crystal over there,

but the only way your dumbass
assin' ass asses

could ever have one
is if it was stolen.

You stole a time-freezing
crystal from testicle monsters?!

I would've been happy to pay
for it, s... [BURPS] Summer,

but they don't exactly
sell them at Costco.

Besides, there's a larger lesson
to be learned here. Get him!

No, no, no, no!
You better keep back!

Man, this will turn your ass

into a third-trimester fetus
from 30 yards.

[ MONITOR BEEPING ]

Mm.

Isn't there a kitten somewhere
that needs a manicure?

That's right, Mrs. Smith.
Give in to your anger.

Neglect that deer.

Honey, it's gonna be okay.

These men are
from the Cervine Institute

of of elk, moose, deer,
and stag.

They can take this deer
to a helicopter

and fly it to the country's
top deer surgeon

on a wildlife reserve
across the state border.

Where your jurisdiction ends.

I guess that's the end of that.

There is just one more thing.

According to this state's
Veterinarian statute,

this animal can't be transferred

until the current
attending physician

verbally confirms
their inability

to provide adequate care.

You heard the man, horse doctor.

You have to say
you couldn't hack it.

We did it!

Uh-huh. No, mother... no.
Earth, dude.

No, I'm talking about...
Yeah, with the dinosaurs.

No, if you get to the dolphin
people, you gone too far.

All right, man,
I'll talk to you later. Okay.

You know what they do

to third-dimensional life
forms in time prison?

Same thing they do in every
other prison, only forever.

Why are you doing this?

You think I want to be
an omniscient immortal being

transcending time and space
my whole life?

I got ambitions, man.

Bringing you guys in
is my ticket up.

What if I told you
there's a huge ticket

up right behind you?

You really think
I'm that stupid?

All right, hear me out on this.

You're immortal, right, which
means your life is infinite.

Okay, well, then that means
there's a 100% chance

that you'll
eventually do everything,

including turning around
to look behind you.

I cannot argue that.

[ THUD! ]
- Aaah!

[ SQUEALS ]
Oh, god, gross and weird!

Chris! [ SPLAT! ]

You killed my gun!

RICK: Summer, Morty,
take off your collars.

What? What the hell
are you doing?

Good question. I suppose
the answer is I'm not certain.

Oh, no, what are you doing?

- I have no idea.
- I'm not sure.

Stop it!

[ ECHOING ] Maybe I will,
maybe I won't.

I'm really uncertain
about everything,

even kicking your ass.

List... hey! Tw... ow!

But the... these arms
are vestigial! [ GRUNTS ]

an eye would've been

about 6 million years ago.

SUMMER: [ ECHOING ] Come
on, let's help Grandpa.

MORTY: [ ECHOING ] Yes! I'm
100% not sure about anything!

Yeah, totally uncertain.

Beat his ass!
Get him! Beat him up!

- Kick his ass, Rick!
- Die, motherfucker.

Ow! I'm defeated.

- What's happening?
- Time is falling apart.

We've got to get back
to certainty quick.

Give me your collars.

Oh, man. Don't you have to fix,
like, 30 of them?

Morty, I have to fix three
of them.

And then there's other versions of me

that have to also fix three,
for a total of 96.

I'm not an idiot.
I know how to be decisive.

Now hand me
that flat-head screwdriver.

- Actually, make it a flat-head.
- Actually, make it a phillips.

Oh, shit.

Look, I know I was
kind of a nuisance today.

I know it's my fault
we hit the deer.

And I know you wanted
to be the one to save it.

Whatever.

How petty would I have
to be to care less

about an animal's life
than my own ego?

Well, you'd have
to be pretty petty.

But you'd still be
the woman I married.

[ CAR RATTLES ]
Where are we going?

One last stop.

[ TIRES SQUEAL ]

Where's the helicopter?

There is no helicopter.

And there is
no Cervine Institute.

But the top deer surgeon...

I'm looking at her.

Thanks for teeing me
up like that.

You better get moving.

for basic ice-cream work.

They're not gonna last

Huh? Wait a minute.

- Great.
- Rick!

What's going on?

The collar.
Oh, the latch is broken.

It won't latch closed
around my neck.

- Oh, are you kidding me?
- Geez, what's going on?

How come our collars
aren't green?

Obviously because someone
doesn't know how to put

his collar on, and one of me
is stuck trying to help him.

Don't blame this on me.

You're the one that
couldn't fix a latch.

What are you talking about?
It's not broken, Morty.

I fixed it. Just put it on.

It won't close. It's broken.

Fine, bring it here.

uncertain about everything.

Um, first of all, hello.

Uh, my name is

Second of all,

I'm a murderer that eats babies,

and I came to this planet
to eat babies.

However, I am also carrying
a highly infectious disease

that I suppose you could call
"Space AIDS" as you put it.

And Rick did chain me up

so that he could
attempt to cure it.

At the same time,

Rick's motivation
to cure my disease

was not to save my life
or anyone else's,

but to patent and sell the cure
for billions of blemflarcks.

But you know the reason why

I ripped my chains
out of the wall?

And do you know why I'm never
coming back to this planet?

Because the two of you
are the fucking worst!

You both hate yourselves
and each other.

And the idea that it has
anything to do with Rick

is laughable.

I'd laugh,
but I'm biologically incapable.

That's how alien I am.

And even I'm sitting here
listening to the two of you

dormant.

Morty, get down!

Whoa-ho-ho!

Whoa!

[ BACTERIA SNARL ]

Whoa, whoa, whoa!

[ GRUNTING ]

Oh, what are those things?

Tuberculosis...
coming in fast!

Not faster than a bullet!

Aah!

DR. BLOOM:
No!

Do you know what you've done?!

[ COUGHS ]

ALL:
Whoa!

Get to the digestive tract!

He's coughing!

[ COUGHS ]

Whoaaaa!

Don't let me die!

Just take a deep breath, Reuben.

[ GASPS ]

You're not gonna die!

What's your name?

My name is...

[ COUGHS ]

Alexand...
[ SCREAMS ]

[ COUGHS ]

[ ALL GRUNT ]

Rick... R-R-Reuben's got
tuberculosis!

Oh, great work, Morty.

Okay, I'll just
cure it and then...

[ FLATLINE ]

Okay.

Well, I can't cure death.

This is bad, Morty.

You're trapped in a dead man.

Listen, if the situation
keeps darkening,

do yourself a favor and pop by
Pirates of the Pancreas.

Obviously I'm biased,
but I think it's great, Morty.

It's a bunch of [BELCHES]
pirates running around a

[BELCHES] pancreas.

We don't whitewash it,
either, Morty.

I mean, the pirates
are really rapey.

The top priority is to get,
you know, you guys out of there,

but I'm just saying, if that
becomes impossible, please,

you gotta treat yourself.

Oh, man.

W-w-w-what is
that horrible smell?

You mean the Panda Express?

[ CHUCKLES ]

Kidding. I-I'm kidding.

The body is beginning to
constrict and fill with gas.

We're inside a corpse, my boy.

Anatomy Park is doomed.

Forget about the park, doctor!

How do we get out?

The digestive tract is the
evacuation route.

Get it?

There's an emergency station in
the colon with a ray that can

enlarge us all.

Everybody, head for the colon!

Now I'm taking orders
from a 12-year-old boy?

Morty, the scar sacs containing
the tuberculosis were sabotaged.

This disaster was an inside job.

Keep your eye on Annie.

She was written up several times

by her manager
at the Churro Stand.

Intestines are ahead to the
left, then to the right,

then left, ET cetera.

Hey, just so you know,
l-I-I'm actually 14.

So, you know...
what?

Not 12.

Okay.

You know, because
he just said I was 12.

Oh.

You can put your fingers
wherever you want.

RICK: Morty, you want to put it
on mute or something?

I'm... I'm trying to

Uh... Rick?

Not now, Jerry.

I've got [BELCHES] much,
much smaller fish to fry.

I wanted to say I'm sorry
I ever judged you.

Right now,
you're my sanest relative.

Relative.

R-relative size!

Jerry, hand me a scalpel
and a bundle of dynamite.

Morty, can you get
to the left nipple?

Are you kidding?

I'm hoping I can get
to both of 'em, Rick.

No, Morty, I'm talking about
Reuben's left nipple.

[ RUMBLING ]

[ GRUNTS ]

We need to get
to the left nipple!

The body is decaying.

The arterial transit
system is useless.

We can try the service shuttle.

It's connected to
the skeletal system.

That's why we call
it the bone train.

Would you like to ride
the bone train, Miss?

If it'll get us out of here.

How about you, Morty?

Would you like to
ride the bone train?

Why are you doing this bit?

We're gonna die! Let's go!

Well... I can see you're busy.

Merry Christmas, Rick.

[ GROANS ]

There's no autopilot.

One of us will have to stay
here and operate it manually.

[ SCREAMS ]

We're in the areola, Rick...

almost to the nipple, but we're
also in a really bad situation!

RICK:
I'm almost there, Morty!

Reports from all over the
country have been coming in

about what appears
to be a giant,

naked man over the
continental United States.

We now go to Tom Randolph
in New York. Tom?

Well, the eyes aren't twinkling
and the dimples aren't merry,

but I'm standing under a
nose like a 70-mile cherry.

Thank you, Tom.

Let's go now to Eric McMahan
in Los Angeles.

We've got feet here on
the West Coast, Bill...

giant feet,

even relative to the
giant man's size,

and you know what
they say about that.

Well, if the old adage is true,

one can only wonder what's going
down in the Rocky Mountains.

Wha?

[ SCREAMS ]

Oh my God, the track!

It's Hepatitis A!

Aaaah!

It's beautiful.

[ ROARS ]

Oh, no!

Holy crap!

Whoa! It's Hepatitis C!

[ GRUNTS ]

Um... wait...

Did we have some sort of
relationship with him?

I think they're just like that?

I think they're just good guys.

Oh. Huh.

RICK:
Where's Dr. Bloom?

I'm sorry, Rick, but he's dead.

God damn it, Morty.

I ask you to do one thing!

Jerry doesn't know
what he's missing.

He'll come around, Beth.

Christmas is a special time.

It has funny ways of
bringing families together.

I don't know, Jacob.

Jerry got an invitation to be
alive today, and he rejected it.

I don't know if
our marriage will...

[ GASPS ]

It's raining blood!

Oh, shit. Find Jerry.

Oh, God.

Jerry!
It's all right.

The TV says there's
nothing to worry about.

The giant, naked sky
Santa has exploded.

Blood and chunks of viscera are
raining down on the country.

Everything should be fine.

[ ALL SIGH ]

Oh, yes.

Dad, can I have my phone back?

A sure, sweetie. Here.

Everybody, take a device.

It'll help you relax.

This is nice.

Yeah.

Look, I guess we really learned
something this Christmas, Jacob.

No, we didn't, Dad.

No, we didn't.

RICK:
Too bad about Dr. Bloom.

He was a genius...

the only man capable of
creating a new Anatomy Park.

Actually, I studied
Dr. Bloom's work.

I-I-I-I believe I have the
knowledge necessary to create

an entirely new,
much safer park.

What about...

Pirates of the Pancreas?

I think it was one of the
most underrated attractions.

Boo-yah!
Hold your breath.

Hey, w-w-what the hell,
Rick?!

What the hell, man! I liked her!

I really had something
going there, Rick!

Yeah, so I heard.

like a problem to me.

we asked ourselves over here,

"Okay, what does
a pancreas do?"

and the answer was,
"Does it make pirates?"

No, it makes insulin, you know?

- You know what?

Why am I doing that?
That's more rude than the truth.

Look, I'm sorry, Morty.
I just don't think --

Do not. Even.
You have no need to explain.

It's all good.

I think you'd get bored with me.

E-Exactly.
Look, the sparks aren't flying.

This is what dating is for,
you know?

[LAUGHS]
First date, no sparks.

No damage, no worries.
Life is a highway.

We're gonna ride it
all night lonnngg!

Gonna eat some "erudite."
Mmm!

Is this organic? Mmm.
All right.

You know, the evening continues.

Okay, here we go.

Ma'am, I'm afraid I have
some bad news for you.

Your money's no good here.
[LAUGHS]

I'll -- I'll get the next round,
sir.

- Aren't you a child?
- Only in the ways that matter.

- Morty.
-[ SIGHS ] Stacy.

I've been watching you drink,
Stacy.

I get the feeling
you've got a hard job.

I wonder what it takes
to please you.

That's the job I want --
part time, full time,

I want to be good at it,
bad at it.

I want to get promoted, fired,
corner office, hostile takeover,

workplace accident.

I'm on my knees, Stacy,

praying, worshiping, begging,
whatever you want.

[SNIFFS]
What do you think about that?

Okay. Fuck it.

-[ GLASSES CLINK]
- Tink.

-[ TIRES SCREECH ]
- STACY: [GIGGLING ] Mm!

MORTY: Let's ask my grandpa.
He's a scientist.

Hey, Rick, are you familiar
with Ben Wa technology?

Morty, great news.

I went back to the spa,
and they let me purchase

the containment unit
from their detoxifier.

Why?

Because we're coming home,
bitch!

What is this?

This is the parts of your pussy
grandpa that keep it real.

Oh -- Oh, and I think
you dropped something, too!

I don't want to be on-camera.
I'm ugly and gross. Please.

- Should I go?
- You're your own person, Stacy.

Then I'd like to stay.

Rick, please tell me

you're not trying to put
that stuff back inside of us.

Morty, I'm sorry. That stuff
is alive and it belongs with us.

We yanked them from their homes
and locked them in a can.

-[ CLANKS]
- Motherfucker!

See?
They're living in pain.

That's what they do, Rick.
They live in pain.

They are pain, you know?

Th-They're all the bad parts
of us, which, by the way,

includes our dishonesty,

so how do you know this isn't
all some sort of crazy trick?

Oh, so now because
I'm made entirely of toxins,

I'm also a liar?

Fuck you, you little sociopath.
You hear this, Morty?

Oh, everybody hates me.
I can tell.

- Y-You all hate me --
- All right, shut up, Morty.

Healthy Rick,
are we doing this or what?

Yep. Sorry, Morty. I need you
to step into the booth.

Don't negotiate
with that little turd, dummy.

You're the Rick.
You need to show dominance.

Morty, booth, now. Booth!

- Come on, Morty.
- Don't touch me!

Morty, do the healthy thing and
voluntarily retoxify yourself.

Nooooo!

Is it wrong if I think
this is kind of hot?

Let me out of here!
Stacy, help! Open the door!

I need to hear our safe word,
Morty.

Sea Cucumber!
Sea Cucumber!

What are you doing?

I'll do anything for you, Morty.

[ BOOTH HISSES, WHIRS]

It worked! [ LAUGHS ] Yes!
That idiot believed every word.

Now let's see how he enjoys
living in that shit tank.

He's right behind me, isn't he?

- He's in <i>front</i> of you.
- My eyes are still adjusting.

Uh, is this like a sex dungeon?

I guess I should've been
paying attention.

GUNK RICK: After 70 years
of being bottled up

inside a [BURPS]
sentimental jackass,

I finally get to live
my own life.

You said we were merging.

I lied, dumb-ass!
I lie about everything!

Why would I ever re-merge
with a pussy like you?

So...you were just gonna trap us
in that tank?

T-That was your plan?

Not was, motherfucker.
Still is.

-[ GROANS]
- Kill him, Rick!

I don't like this!
This is scary!

All right, you asked for it.

- Did I ask for this?
-[ GROANS]

Did I ask for this?
Huh? Did I?

<i>-[ WHIRS ]
- Assessing threat to groin.</i>

Groin System 6000.
Kill him!

[WHIRS, BEEPS]

<i>That...is my groin's user.</i>

Believe me, I got a lot more use
out of that thing

than he ever did.

<i>You know what?
Not my table.</i>

[GRUNTING]

<i>- You do know me.
-[ GASPS</i> ]

What the hell, Grandpa Rick?

- Fuck you, Summer!
- Sorry, Summer!

[BEEP]

Okay, okay, take it easy.
Don't do it.

[RAPID BEEPING,
CREATURE WHIMPERS ]

I love you. Good boy.
Daddy's little boy.

Summer, get out of here! Go!

Oh, who's that?

Who[BURPS]'s that over there?

Oh, no. You see the bad man
in front of you?

You're a good little boy.
You're gonna get him.

-[ CREATURE ROARS ]
- You're gonna get him.

- Aah!
-[ SCREAMS]

Son of a...

[GRUNTS]

[ SCREAMS, MOANS]

[SCREAMS]
Ahh!

[ ROARS]

Nice try, asshole.

We can resolve
[PANTING] our issues.

We don't need to resort
to over-the-top --

[GROANS]

Aah!

L-I did it, Rick.
I got the tank!

L-I'm a piece of shit,
but I got the tank!

You're going in that tank,
motherfucker.

You're gonna [BURPS] live in
that toxic shit wasteland

like I had to do!

- Aah!
"Ow!

[SCREAMING]

GUNK RICK:
That's right, motherfucker.

You're going in that fuckin' --

Dads?

Okay, just --
just leave her out of it.

What's going on?

All right, fuck this.
Time for plan B.

If I can't trap you
in a toxic world,

I'll just make the whole world
toxic.

It's okay, girls.

L-I'm so sorry I put us in
danger with some of my behavior.

L-if you'd like,
I can go out in the g-garden,

pick some fresh basil,
and make us a nice Scallopini.

What did the booger version
of you mean

when he said he was going to
make the whole world toxic?

Believe me, sweetie, that man's
motivations are a mystery.

Screw that, Rick.
We got to stop him.

What's the last thing
you'd think about doing

with that tank thing?

Morty, I appreciate
what you're trying to do,

but it's not our place,
you know,

to pick and choose which world
gets saved from what apocalypse.

Our -- Our toxins have as much
a right to their worldview as --

Morty, how is it healthy
to slap me?

Obviously my version of health
is a hell of a lot different

from yours,
you useless old turd.

Wait. That's it.

How could that detox machine
know the difference

between healthy and sick for
everything that goes through it?

It can't.

It must be by the individual's
own definition of toxicity.

That means...

- Dad!
- What -- What the hell, Rick?

I'll explain on the way.

GUNK RICK:
This "Moon Tower," Morty,

I[BURPS]s the perfect height
and metallic composition

for the a..[BURPS]..mplification
and beaming of toxic energies.

What do you think about that,
Morty?

Are you excited about that,
Morty?

Oh, man. I'm just freaked out.
I-It's too high up here.

Once I flip this switch,

the entire world is gonna
be just as toxic as us, baby.

[ ELECTRICAL CRACKLING ]

As we praise
our loving Father --

God is a lie!
We made him up for money!

[BELLS CHIMING]

[ LAUGHTER, SQUEAKING]

Santa Claus isn't real.

You were all mistakes!
[GROANS]

[LAUGHS]
We fuckin' did it, Morty.

Put your fuckin' hands
in the air.

Yeah, you little piece of shit.

Remember me?

Didn't you learn last time
that you can't beat me?

Yeah, I did. And then I learned
something else.

- This.
- Aah! [ SCREAMS, MOANS]

That bullet is laced with
an encrypted nanobotic virus

that will disintegrate your
Morty in about, ah, 20 minutes.

You think I give a shit?

I know you give a shit, dummy.

Because I know I don't.

Here's another thing I know.

The decryption key
that neutralizes the virus.

You want it?
Come and get it.

Merge with me and you'll know
how to save him.

Pfft. Come on, man.
I've been trapped

in your pussy brain
for 70 years of delusions,

but this is the all-time weakest
bluff that I've ever --

Jesus Christ!
What are you doing?!

He's cutting your time in half.

-10 minutes.
- What is your problem?

Oh, I had all my problems
removed -- my entitlement,

my narcissism,
my crippling loneliness,

my irrational attachments.

They must be somewhere.
They ain't over here, bro.

I'm not going back in there!

Honestly,
I don't care either way.

I hate having you in me.

And when I say "honestly"
you can believe it,

because we both know
I'm too healthy to lie.

- Watch.
-[ SCREAMS ]

All right! Knock it off!
You're not impressing anyone.

Morty, not that I give a shit,
but are you okay?

- Jesus Christ, it hurts.
- Relax, quit your bitching.

Y-You're gonna be fine.
Grandpa's here.

-[LAUGHS]
- You think that's funny?

Y-You got to have a sense
of humor about these things.

Oh, wait, you can't.

You're literally incapable
of seeing the bigger picture.

I guess it's just funny
because you've never done

anything but complain
about me being in charge,

but if I ever gave you the wheel
we'd be dead in five minutes.

- Rick?
- You poor, dumb, sick animal.

[WEAKLY] Rick?

Aah! Just do it!

Just do it, you piece of --

[GROANS]

I'm back, baby! Regular Rick!
Master of both worlds!

Check it it out!
[ FARTS]

"Excuse me."

Now we'll just reverse
this hacky toxicity beam.

Man, I really overthink shit
when I'm angry.

[ ELECTRICITY CRACKLES,
POWERS DOWN ]

-[ MOANING]
- Oh, give it to me.

Mm, ma-mah.

God is not a lie.

[WHOOSH! ]

[BELLS CHIME]

[ANIMALISTIC SCREECHING]

[WAILING]

Mommy! Mommy!

Ha! All right, Morty,

now it's time we re-merge
your little ass.

You're a better man
than me, Rick.

I'm healthy
enough to admit that!

That kid
is a real piece of shit.

Y-Y-You're gonna save me, right?

Part of me wanted to,
Toxic Morty.

Part of me really wanted to.

[CAR HORN BEEPS]

I'm telling you,
these shares are hot. Yeah.

That sounds like a good idea.
It's definitely a good idea.

MORTY: Duane, Duane, Duane,
I get it. Now can you get me?

Have I ever lied to you?

That's right, and ask around,
l never do,Duane.

Let me put this real simple.

This stock is a beautiful
redhead, recently single,

not looking to date
but ready to fall in love,

and fate has put her locker
two down from yours, Duane --

Two lockers down.

So step up or step off, Duane.

Blue pill or red pill,
what'll it be, bro?

Totally understand, Duane.

- You're the boss.
-[ PHONE BEEPS]

[CHOPPING]

[CRUNCH]

Mmm! Is this organic?

Mmm!

-[ CELLPHONE VIBRATES]
- Go for Morty.

JESSICA:
Hi, Morty. It's Jessica.

Look, can we just talk
for a minute?

Is that how long it takes
for Rick to trace my location?

JESSICA: Come back, Morty.
I miss you.

You miss the old me.

You miss someone
that loved you so much,

you never had to love 'em back.

JESSICA: How do you know
I don't want to love you?

- Because I'm not sick.
- Ex-girlfriend?

Should I be jealous?

There's nothing
to be jealous of.

I just realized
that I'm scheduled

to speak at that fundraiser
on our date night.

I can cancel.

We'll be together.
That's a date.

You are the perfect man.

Oh, sweetie, I think you hit
the wrong button.

You didn't hang up.

Huh. How 'bout that?

[GLASS SHATTERS]

[MECHANICAL WHIRRING]

Sorry, tiny American Psycho.

Time to take the op[BURPS]posite
of your medicine.

Do what you got to do.
[SCREAMS]

Oh! Ow! Aah!

So, how do you feel, Morty?

- Ah, geez. I'm miserable.
- Am I good or what?

I guess it's worth it, though,
to know how much you care.

Care? Me?
Morty, I'm fine with you.

- I only did this for him.
- You lying bitch.

She kept coming to our house,
Morty, and kept asking me,

"Did -- Did -- D-Did you get
a new Morty yet?"

Because you kept drunk-dialing
me and crying about it.

I wasn't crying!

Jacquelyn, I--

I-I-I wasn't who I said I was.

You weren't a 14-year-old boy
from the Midwest

who ran away from his family
and capitalized

on his lack of conscience
by becoming a stock broker?

Oh. I guess I was pretty
up front about that, wasn't I?

You were up front
about everything.

You were my soul mate.

Well...
N-Not anymore. I'll, um...

Y-You can keep the apartment

and -- and -- and,
uh...the drones.

She can't keep the drones.

They turn into
a little Voltron robot.

They're awesome.

[ELECTRICAL WHIRRING]

You can't keep the drones.

[SCHOOL BELL RINGS]

So, how was your date with Brad?

It wasn't a date.
We were just having lunch.

You guys are getting
back together, aren't you?

Morty, I need your help
on an adventure.

Eh, "need" is a strong word.

We need door stops,
but a brick would work, too.

Okay.

Morty.

Good to have you back.

Have you ever been peed on
before?

Oh, my God. Yum.

﻿T-T-T-This is just

Hey, Rick.

Boy, sure is really especially
beautiful out there today, huh?

Oh, yes, Morty.

L-it's almost unbelievable,
isn't it?

Yeah, you know?

There's something about the air

and just the way the sunshine is.

Uh, sure, buddy. Yeah.

Sure. B-brilliant. Very convincing.

Wha... convincing?

Oh. Responsive, too.

In real time. I love it.

Uhh... okay.

[ ROBOTIC ] I'm going to work.

Morty, good morning.

Dad, good morning.

I am going to work. Goodbye.

What's with mom?

Oh, what's with mom?

So, you're saying that
she's acting weird?

How soph[BURPS]isticated.

Careful, guys.

You're gonna burn out

Okay, you know what, Rick?

You're acting weird, too.

Whatever,

All right, well...

I'll see you after school.

Ow! Oof! Ugh!

Damn it!

I'm all right. I'm okay.

me what 5 x 9 is?

[ STUDENTS WHISPERING ]

Morty?

Uh, me?

What is 5 x 9?

Umm... you know,
it's uhh ...at least 40.

[ STUDENTS GASP ]

Morty, that's exactly correct!

5 x 9 is at least 40!

Come up here.

Whoo! Way to go, Morty!

Everybody,
this is the best student.

I want you to be
the teacher today.

Teach us, Morty!

Interesting.

W-w-w-what do you
want me to teach you?

Ooh, ooh!

How do you make
concentrated dark matter?

Oh, that's a good question.

Concentrated huh?

Concentrated dark matter...

the fuel for accelerated
space travel.

Now, do you know how to make it?

Umm...

JESSICA:
Come on, Morty.

Isn't your grandpa,
like, a scientist?

Oh, yeah, but, you know,
he told me that I shouldn't go

around spouting off about, you
know, his science and stuff.

I bet you've seen him make
concentrated dark matter a lot.

You know, if you tell us,
I'll be your girlfriend.

Uh, y-you will?

Seems like a rare opportunity,
Morty.

[ BLAM! ]

Morty, u-uh, come on.
There's a family emergency.

Stop right there!

If he leaves,
I'm giving him an "F."

RICK:
He doesn't care.

Aw, man!

Rick, I have to go back!

I think I was about
to get married!

Ugh! Take a shower with me,
Morty.

What?!

Listen to me, Morty.

Get your clothes off and
get in the shower right now.

Y-y-y-you got to
trust me, Morty.

Ugh!

I'm gonna get an
"F" in class, Rick.

Morty, that's not class.

T-T-T-That wasn't your teacher.

This isn't your school.

This entire world
is not the world.

We're inside a huge simulation
chamber on an alien spaceship.

Wait a minute.

W-what are you talking about?

It's all fake [BURPS] Morty...
all of it.

Nanobotic renderings, a bunch
of crazy fake nonsense, Morty.

I couldn't say so until
we got in the shower.

They won't monitor us in here.

Monitor us?! W-who?!

Zigerion scammers, Morty...

the Galaxy's most ambitious,
least successful con artists.

You know, it's lucky for
us they're also really

uncomfortable with nudity.

Aw, come on, Rick.

If everyone's just
gonna be insane today,

at least let me be
insane with Jessica.

I can't [BURPS] let
you do that, Morty.

Give it to me!

No! [ BURPS ]

You give it to me!

G-g-give it! No, Rick!

[ ALIENS GROANING ]

Oh, God, Sir!

Uh, sir, we have
a situation over here.

If there's a wiener on that

Oh, wait. No wonder.

There's another real

big pitch meeting.

[ WHIRRING]

You can do this.

How did this happen?!

Where's the
Abductions Department?

Hey, man, Abductions just
follows the acquisition order.

Don't put this on Acquisitions!

We only acquire humans that
haven't been simulated!

Well, simulations doesn't
simulate anybody that's been

abducted,
so [CHUCKLES] oh, I see!

Oh, oh!
It was no one's fault.

Oh, okay. [ CHUCKLES ]

I'm sorry.
Well, then, problem solved.

Oh, wait... no.

There's still another
human in here!

Who is he?

Rick's son-in-law,
Jerry Smith.

So far, he hasn't noticed
he's in a simulation.

[ SIGHS ]

Well, cap his sector at 5%
processing,

keep his settings on auto, and
we'll deal with him later.

we can speak freely.

Do you really think

You'd have to be an idiot not to
notice all the sloppy details.

Look... that guy's putting
a bun between two hot dogs.

MORTY:
I don't know, Rick.

I mean, I've seen people
do that before.

RICK:
Well, look at that old lady.

She's... she's walking
a cat on a leash.

Uh, Mrs. Spencer does
that all the time, Rick.

Look, I-I-l don't want to
hear about Mrs. Spencer, Morty!

She's an idiot!

All right, all right, there.

W-what about that, Morty?

MORTY:
Okay, okay, you got me on that one.

Oh, really, Morty?

Are you sure you haven't
seen that somewhere

in real life before?

No, no.
I haven't seen that.

I mean, why would a
pop tart want to live inside

a toaster, Rick?

I mean, that would be, like, the
scariest place for them to live.

You know what I mean?

You're missing the point, Morty.

Why would he drive a smaller
toaster with wheels?

I mean, does your car look like
a smaller version of your house?

No.

So, why are they doing this?

W-what do they want?

Well, that would be
obvious to you, Morty,

if you'd been paying attention.

[ SIREN WAILS ]

[ TIRES SCREECH ]

We got the President of the
United States in here!

We need 10cc of concentrated
dark matter, stat, or he'll die!

Concentrated dark matter?

They were asking
about that in class.

Yeah, it's a special fuel I
invented to travel through

space faster than anybody else.

These Zigerions are always
trying to scam me out of my secrets,

but they made a big
mistake this time, Morty.

They dragged you into this.

Now they're gonna pay!

What do you...
w-w-what are we gonna do?

We'll scam the scammers, Morty.

And we're gonna take them for
everything they've got.

Um, simple question, gentlemen,
[ HOARSELY ] what are apples?

[ CLEARS THROAT ] Excuse me.

Ahh.

Apples are food.

And... when do we need food?

with the virtual world
disappearing behind us

I put a spatially
tessellated void

inside a modified temporal field

until a planet developed

I then introduced that life
to the wonders of electricity,

which they now generate
on a global scale.

And, you know, some of it goes
to power my engine

and charge my phone and stuff.

You have a whole planet
making your power for you?

- That's slavery.
- It's society.

They work for each other, Morty.

They pay each other.
They buy houses.

They get married and make
children that replace them

when they get
too old to make power.

That just sounds like slavery
with extra steps.

gonna get laid in college.

being revisited

by the alien known as Rick,
who once gave our world

the gift
of gooble box technology,

improving our daily lives,
while safely removing

the dangerous waste power
to a special disposal volcano.

But why has Rick returned?

And what will he say
when he hears the big news?

that you were having problems

to see your new energy source.

I think he could learn
a lot from you, Zeep.

Fine.

It's hard for people to grasp,

but inside that container is
an infinite universe

with a planet capable
of generating

massive amounts of power.

I call it a miniverse.

more slowly in the miniverse

relative to the real world?

Yes, Chris.
Thanks for reminding me of that.

Great President.

Whoa-Oh!

Hold on to something.

I put an unbounded vacuum
inside a temporal field

until a world developed.

I then introduced
the people of this world

to the wonders of electricity
in the form of a device

I call a flooble crank.

What they don't know is that 80%
of every crank's energy output

gets channeled
out of the miniverse

to be used by us.

No more gooble boxes.

with no disrespect,

I really think what
you're doing here is unethical.

- It's not cool.
- What?!

on this world slaving away

making your power.

what I call slavery.

telling this guy

that his miniverse is unethical?

D-Do you not see
the hypocrisy here?

Holy crap.
You're right, Morty. Hypocrisy!

Somewhere on this planet,
there's gotta be an arrogant...

scientist prick on the verge
of microverse technology,

which would threaten to make
Zeep's flooble cranks obsolete,

forcing Zeep
to say microverses are bad,

at which point he'll realize
what a hypocrite he's being.

His people will go back to
stomping on their gooble boxes,

and you and I will be
on ice cream street, baby!

ice cream!

[ BOTH GRUNTING ]

[ BOTH GROAN ]

Aah!

Unh!

[ SNORTS, SPITS ]

Class dismissed.

Geez.

[ BOTTLES CLATTER ]

- You all right?
- Uh-Huh!

What are you doing, Rick?

I'm pretty sure
the battery's dead.

Oh, you think so, huh, Morty?

Well, let's see.
[ ENGINE TURNS OVER ]

Hey, wait... Huh?
I don't get it.

Of course you don't.
But Zeep did.

He knew that once I got
back to my car,

one of two things
was gonna happen...

I was gonna have to toss
a broken battery,

or the battery wouldn't
be broken.

Peace among worlds, Rick.

Jesus.

Yeah. Listen to that baby purr.

You were right, Morty...

We really just needed to
be honest with those guys.

All right, here we go.

Thank y-o-o-o...

See, Morty?
This is what it's all about.

This is why we do what we do.

- Uh-Huh.
- Ew! What the hell?

Jesus!
There's flies in my ice cream.

Presidential decree...

All ice cream is now
for all beings,

no matter how many legs.

What the fuck
did you do, Summer?!

It was your ship!
Your stupid ship did it!

- Don't blame my ship!
- It melted a child!

My ship doesn't do anything
unless it's told to!

I don't want to hear it, Summer!

Your boobs are
all hanging about,

and you ruined ice cream
with your boobs out.

And don't even try
to deny it, either.

MORTY: [ GROANS ]

[ CAR ALARM CHIRPS ]

[ ENGINE REVS, STUDENTS SCREAM ]

[ ALARM BLARING, HORN HONKING ]

Oh, my god!

Did you get any of that?

It's a good show!

What is on Jessica's
Instagram again.

Get out of here, jerk!

What's so embarrassing,
Morty?

Sharing it with your family
might help.

Summer, stop shaming
your brother.

Morty, stop being a creepy,
perverted cyberstalker.

I'm not cyberstalking!

I-I-I just wanted to know where
she got this necklace from.

And now I know.

Her -- Her -- Her grandma
left it to her.

You're quiet, Rick.

Shouldn't you be revealing
grandmas aren't real?

Hi. I've placed an auto-response
chip in my brain

so I can spend time
with my family.

But you arespending time
with your family.

Thank you
for talking to Rick.

Alright, I'm finished
with my breakfast

and my Amazon wish list.
Let's go, Morty.

I need death crystals
from Forbodulon Prime.

Uh...

Dad?
There's a way we do this now.

Morty, would you please
accompany me

to Forbodulon Prime
for death crystals?

Well, thank you for asking.
Yes, I will do that.

It isa hot photo.

I think grief
flushes your cheeks.

Dad, you hardly put
any syrup on.

Honey, stop raising
your father's cholesterol

so you can take
a hot funeral selfie.

I never get to do
anything.

Uh, Rick,
maybe if we go a little --

Faster?
Good idea, Morty.

It'll get us through these
asteroids sooner.

Geez, you're really thispissed
about my mom making sure

I'm okay
with our adventures?

What's next, Morty?
What if I want you to jump off

- the Empire State Building? I have to ask?
- Yes?

And you seriously don't see how
that's a slippery slope?

Just shut up and help me
with these, please.

Why are they called
death crystals?

D-Do they kill you?

You're thinking of bullets,
Morty.

Death crystals show you
how you're gonna die.

Jesus Christ!
I-I die a million times?

Your future stems from
your present,

which, if you're living right,
keeps changing.

Truth is, anyone that knows how
they're definitely gonna die

is either boring as hell
or about to get shot.

Duck!

Who are those guys?!

Crystal poachers.

There's no lower form
of life.

They think the galaxy's
their own personal piggy bank.

Wait, then what are we?

We're Rick and Morty.

You're about to witness the only
real use for these crystals.

They show you when
the other guy's reloading.

Certain death, certain death,
certain death, uncertain death.

And certain death,
certain death, certain death.

Definitely gonna get shot
by this guy;

this is totally my fate;
nothing I could possibly do;

okay, now,
not so much.

Help me gather these up.

You just use these
to win fights? Idon't use them.

People that spend their life
avoiding death are already dead.

They're also rich, and I like to
spend my life with their money.

Oh, my God. Morty!

Jessica!
Oh!

I love you.

Oh! Whoa! Whoa!

Morty.Oh! Oh! Oh!

I love you.

Jessica.
I want to die with Jessica.

Ahh!
What are you doing?

Oh, um, c-can I drive?
Why?

The...feel of the open road?

Alright!
Who's this grandson?

I like his style.

- Morty, you know outer space is up, right?
- Yeah, yeah.

I'm just, uh,
following...my...instincts.

Will you just go up?
Stop!

You're gonna make me
die wrong!Wait a minute, what?

Morty, do you have
a death crystal in your pocket?

No! Maybe!
You little monster!

I thought you were
masturbating!

And you took that
in stride?!

You'd rather
I address it?!

Why would I be doing it?!

Why would you steal
a death crystal?!

I want to die old!

Then stop driving!

No!
You son of a bitch!

Give me the wheel, Morty.

Goddamn it.

Ohhh, shit.

Oh, shit, oh, shit,
oh, shit, oh, shit.

I love you, Morty.

I will avenge my death.

Holy shit!
Just kidding.

I'm a crisis detection
and correction hologram

generated by a chip that
"real" Rick put in your spine.

"Real" in quotes because calling
density-privileged entities

"real"
is incredibly holo-phobic.

Morty, do me a solid --
problematic wordplay aside --

grab the gun with the blue
handle from the trunk

and get a tissue sample
from the corpse.

Alright, now
take that to the trunk

and insert it
into the clone compiler.

I see you appear to be holding
a death crystal

that's guiding your decisions
more than I am.

That's your right.

I just want to remind you that
some people can't hold anything

and can never die, so that's
a little offensive to --

Oh, okay.

Listen, I'm programmed
for tolerance, Morty.

So I'm willing to accept
that you're doing this

if you're willing to accept
that you need to stop.

Accepting.
Rerouted.

Backup. Data.
Operation. Phoenix. Initiated.

What the hell?
I axed this protocol.

What are you doing
with my clone?

It's okay. I'm you.

I took my own clone vat offline
a couple seasons ago,

so I think my backup got
rerouted to your universe.

I'm sorry. All good.
Happy to help.

By the way, annoying
that I even have to ask,

but you are down with
fascist dystopias, right?

YYYYYes.

That "yes" was pretty...

...liberal
with the letter "Y."

Well, isn't this strange.

I trust, the kind of strange
that makes Rick and Morty...

...stronger.

Morty, I caught this socialist
in my bathrobe.

He wants to give
all of our martinis

to a family
of immigrants.

Obviously,
the most likely imposter

is the wet, naked clone.It is obvious.

But it won't be
to the police.

Ohh!
'Kay.

He was an inferior Rick.
He was too political.

I want to have fun, classic
Rick-and-Morty adventures

like in the old days.

Then we'll get along fine,
Fascist Morty.

For starters, I just need to get
to Forbodulon Prime --

You will go
where I want you to go!!

Fuck.

Hey, hey! Ho, ho!

Not cloning your grandpa
has got to go!

Hey, hey! Ho, ho!

Not cloning your grandpa
has got to go!

You don't get out of my face,
I'm gonna flush Rick's DNA.

Alright.
Okay, regroup, everybody.

You, too, Berkeley!

Snap out of it.

At least tell me
what this death is

that you're
so determined to...

Oh. Jessica.

Morty, I love --

What?! No, no!
No, no, no!

I love you.

Damn it!

How am I gonna die with her
if I can't even talk to her?

Here's an idea, Morty.
Throw that thing in the garbage,

stop planning your own death,
and talk to whoever you want.

Now you just sound
like Real Rick.

You're better than
that language, Morty.

I ain't better than shit,
Jack.

So, uh,
w-what are we doing?

Stop asking questions.
Stop doing meta-commentary.

Just have fun.

We're going on a simple,
fun, classic adventure.

Okay, you know what?
It would really help

if you could just say anything
other than what you don't want.

I like Mr. Meeseeks.

Okay, now we're talking.
You know what?

I usually keep a Meeseeks box
in my glove compartment,

so maybe Fascist Rick
does, too.

Ah!
Well, look at that.

Now we're doing something
we've done before.

I'm Mr. Meeseeks!

Kill this Nazi prick!

Can do!

- Come here, you son of a bitch!
- No! Stop!

Accepting. Rerouted.

Backup. Data.
Operation. Phoenix. Initiated.

Aw, come on, man.

Whoa, are you okay?

Yeah, sorry.

I'm a Rick
from another reality.

I-I got uploaded
to your clone vat.

Hey, don't worry about it, man.
I have a dozen.

W-W-What the heck,
Rick?

Are you making clones
down here?

Get outta here, Morty!

Stop asking
stupid questions, Morty!

You sound like a piece of shit.

Aw, geez.

So, tell the truth, man.
No shame.

You're looking at
your shrimp body like "What?!"

Ah, is it that obvious?
I'm sorry.

Yeah, my original body is more
bipedal -- uh, ape-descended.

Really! Weird.

Does your house look
like a tree, or...

No, it looks like this.

It's, like, identical
to this, actually.

That is such a mindfuck.

It's all good, man.
I'm fine with it.

Honestly, you're doing me
a huge favor

by being shrimp
instead of fascists.

What?

Goddamn it!

When did this shit become
the default?!

Who wants to come up
to the board

and show me
some basic-ass integers?

- I love you, Morty.
- Aah!

Morty?
Yeah, right.

That's not an integer!

Apparently,
it doesn't matter.

Damn, Morty,
you're bad at math,

but I'm giving you
an A-plus in confidence.

Just doin'
what I gotta do.

Extra credit!

I love you, Morty.
I love you, Morty.

What's with the strut?

You think you own this school?
- Nope!

What if I killed you?
Would you be strutting then?

Only if the events of the Pixar
movie "Coco" are to be believed,

which I doubt.

I have it on good authority

that you're probably
not gonna kill me.

So why don't you do
what I do

and just go with the flow,
nice and Zen, baby.

Aah! Ugh! Ugh! Ugh!

Ugh! Impotence!

Aah! Impotent rage!

Ugh! Ugh! Ugh!

You die tomorrow,
no matter what.

It's what bullies call
a "fait accompli."

Oh, man! Oh, well, well, well. Mm.

Looks like you got yourself in
a lick of trouble, huh, Morty?

Okay, okay, look,
if you help me not die,

I'll bring Rick
back to life.

Why are you pretending
to eat chicken?

Excuse me?

This chicken is
quite real to me.

Yeah, okay,
but it doesn't have --

Nutrients?
Yeah.

What's the last thing
you ate?

Baloney and an orange.

So, no holographic foods?

So, to me, you never ate?

Or we could try
respecting each other.

Will you just show me
how to stay alive?

Alright, Morty, a deal's a deal.

Once we bring your Rick
back to life,

then I'll help you
with the bully.

Go ahead and open the hatch
to the subterranean lab.

That's where all
the cloning equipment is.

Please tell me you're not
hitting that crystal again.

Look, Rick might be the epitome
of bloated flesh privilege,

but he's right
about one thing.

You're gonna be a lot happier
if you focus on the moment,

rather than on
how you're gonna die.

I mean, w-who's worried
about that, huh?

Sorry, Hologram Rick.

I'm going with the crystal
on this one.

Morty.

Oh, alright, okay.

Just because I can't interact
with solid matter

means you can just
walk all over me?

Dear God.

Bist du faschistisch?

Nope.

Finally.

I thought maybe you were
pussying out.

Hyah!

What the fuck?

Oh, the air's getting thin!

Well, well, well, looks like
there's a new bully in town!

Lucky for us, he just made
bully-bullying the new bullying!

Bully him!

Aah!

We've got an Akira-type
situation going on

behind the mall.
Over.

Dying with Jessica...

Hey!

What the hell?

Aah! Aah!

I'm Mr. Meeseeks!
Look at me!

Shield me from the law!

- Yes, sir! Can do!
- Stand down!

Look at me!

I...will...die...old!

Up next, an unstoppable
science-fiction boy

is attacking our nation's
final line of defense.

Will we all fall
to his deadly touch?

But first, something silly?

What do you mean,
"but first"?

I already said "up next."
You always do this.

I don't alwaysdo shit.
Don't gaslight me.

Gaslighting doesn't exist.

You made it up
'cause you're fucking crazy.

Why are you letting me
do this?

I do as the crystal guides.

Your Honor, my client was acting
in self-defense.

He turned 13 men
into piles of ash.

Sit down!
Before I sentence you,

is there anything
you have to say for yourself?

I...w-w-will a-al-sways --

always r-r-remember
o-our --

our -- our...v-v-t-time --
time...

i-in...f-g-g-g-P-P-Peru.

I will always remember our time
in Peru, Your Honor.

Your Honor,

as you can see, my client
is speaking nonsense.

Stop.

Those were my husband's
last words.

He says that he...l-loves you...

ttt-llll-lit-lit-little --
little

ff-gg-sp-spa-ffggarrow --

sparrow!

He loves you,
little sparrow.

He's innocent.
Case dismissed.

I'm coming for you,
Condor!

Well, I, for one, will not be
accepting this verdict.

And this little monster may
think he's gotten away,

but there is something called
the court of public opinion

that still has final say
in this country.

Oh, I guess he's coming out
of the courthouse now.

Let's go live to that.

People, I gotta tell you
something.

That little boy...

I thought I knew everything
about everything.

But something about the tones
and frequencies

that just came out of his mouth
have made me...

I mean, I think we're just about
ready to forgive him

and move past this whole thing.
He's a free young man.

And as far as continuity goes,
the reset button's been hit.

Morty!
That was a fast trial.

Jess-i-ca?

A bunch of us girls were gonna
go skinny-dipping later,

if you wanted to join.

Actually, now, really.
We're gonna do it right now.

This is the last conversation
I'm having about it

fully clothed.

No, thanks.

I'm...assuming...
we...maybe...

get together...
in our 40s?

Uh, cool.

Sounds...hot.

Bye.

Must...continue...
moving...

in ways...that lead...
to dying...with you.

Whoa!
Way to use up a clone!

What the fuck, man?

What's the matter with you?
Y-Y-You don't talk?

Tarantula
got your tongue?

Uh...
Heil, Wasp Hitler?

What?
What the fuck?

Where's that shit
coming from?

Look, I'm a primate.
I-I'm having a hard time.

I'll think or say
whatever gets me home.

Well, here's how it works
with wasps.

We eat our prey alive,
and when we don't,

we lay our eggs
in their eyeballs

so that our young can feast
on their brains

when they hatch.

When you're born
that big an asshole,

the least you can do is
have a little empathy.

Now, come have dinner
with my beautiful family.

And drop the Hitler stuff.

Wasp Morty's been on
some crazy message boards.

Aah! Aah!

Oh! Aah! Ow!

Me and my friends
want to fly around

and look for something
to sting tonight.

You be careful not to waste
all your venom.

I'm not a bee, Dad.

Oh, God! Kill me!
Please kill me!

Uh, Beth, uh, after dinner,
could I maybe borrow Morty

to help the lost Rick get back
to his primate-based reality?

Morty, are you done
with your homework?

Not all of it.
Sorry, Dad.

Oh, don't be sorry, sweetie.
We're all in this together.

We're wasps, not monsters.

Aah!

Huh, guess I don't have it
as bad as I thought.

Can you pass the acid?

Aah! No!
Run! Run, my babies!

Bonus!

Morty?
Morty?

Where is that little shit?
Morty!

Whoa, garage foul.

Who said you could
go through my stuff?

W-Where's my Boglin?

There you are.
Don't worry, Pop-pop's back.

I'll keep you safe.
What the --

He took my Meeseeks boxes!
All that's left are these

shitty Kirkland brand
Meeseeks boxes.

What do you want?

Damn,
your Morty sucks.

Aah, wasps!

Why the hell
didn't you show Morty

how to bring my body
back to life?

Don't tell me
you gained sentience

and tried to take over.
What?

That is some A.I.,
racist, accusatory,

Isaac Asimov bullshit
right there.

Then what happened?
Where's my body?

Oh, you're gonna
love this.

- I love you, Morty.
- This is my life.

This is good.

What do ya know?

Our little Morty knows
how to scream.

Oh, you're fucked now!
I told you!

Get him, Rick!

Aaaah!

Aah!
I-I can't see my own death.

H-How am I gonna die?!

Shh, quiet, idiot.
Quiet.

It's gonna be alright.

You don't get to know
how you're gonna die.

It's over.
Oh, hey.

This fucking ferrofluid's
wrapping around my legs.

Fuck!
I can feel! I have mass!

I'm a fucking god now!
You're fucked!

What the fuck?

I-I thought you were proud
to be a hologram!

That's 'cause I had
to fucking be one!

Shit! Aaah!

Ugh! Aaah!

There's a lesson here,

and I'm not the one
that's gonna figure it out.

Hey, uh, sorry
I didn't listen to you

and tried to kill
the whole world and stuff.

I guess I got to learn

how to live in the moment
a little more.

Oh, boy, so, you actually
learned something today?

What is this,
"Full House"?

I was living in the moment
all day,

and it kept getting me
killed by Nazis.

I think you have to think ahead
andlive in the moment.

Morty, we saw you on the news.
Are you okay?

Oh, real nice, Rick.
Turning our son into an Akira?

- Real nice.
- Eat my ass, Jerry.

He turned himself
into Akira.

Oh, I'll eat it,
because this is my house, Rick.

- I'll eat any ass I want.
- Gross.

You said the crystals wouldn't
hurt anyone, Dad.

This family has
a clean start.

I don't know if adventures
fit into my son's life.

I'm fine.
Get off Rick's back.

Rick wasn't even here
when I was doing all that stuff.

That was all on me.

Well, alright, Morty.

I guess, as long as you're okay,
that's all we care about.

I don't want to see
any more anime stuff

happening to my son,
buster.

That finger has AIDs now.
Not my fault.

You skipped HIV?

- He's messing with you, sweetie.
- But it's tingling!

So, I guess what we learned
is to split the diff.

From now on, Rick and Morty doing
a little of this and a little of that.

Yeah, sometimes
we'll do classic stuff.

You know, other times,
we'll do whatever!

Sometimes we won't even
do anything!

Rick and Morty do --
not doing anything!

A hundred years!Pushing it to the limit.

Rick and Morty,
not sticking to one path.

Trying different things,

Making sure to keep out
of a rut.

Doing stuff.
Sometimes not doing stuff.

Not even pushing a little bit
towards the limit.

Doing it alone or together.
Making sure to keep our eyes

on the prize.
Sometimes just relaxing.

Or not. And you can do whatever
the fuck you want, Morty.

- That's the end.
- Wait, wait, what the fuck?

H-Hold on. What the fuck
did you just say?

Nothing.
I didn't say anything.

I was just playing along
with you guys.

You know I record everything,
right?

Garage, isolate Summer's voice
and play back.

Oh, and then you guys
can get married,

and, like,
suck each other off

in a testosterone-addled
fucking third-grade-boy.

What, the hell, Summer?!
That's disgusting.

Gross, Summer!
Jesus Christ!

I was just joking around,
you --

just seeing if you guys
pay any attention to me.

Just want to be
a part of the fun.

Get the fuck
out of here!

Get out of here, Summer!

- Fucking disgusting!
- Get out of here!

You ruined
the Season 4 premiere!

The Season 4 premiere,
you ruined it!

God,
tomorrow's career day.

I don't want to think about what
I do when I get out of school.

I know exactly
what I want to do.

I want to work
in hospice.

I want to comfort
the people who are dying,

who have no one else
in their lives --

the real lonely people.

I'm gonna look at their name
tags, and I'm gonna say,

"I love you,"

followed by whatever it says
on their name tag,

over and over.

What the fuck?

Hey, Morty, quick favor.

What, cover me
in gasoline and spiders?

Fine, yeah, I'm in.

Wasn't my first pitch,

but, hey, not gonna waste
this opportunity.

Did you get any of that?

﻿I -- I can't hold them off,
Rick!

Th-There's too many!

Richard!

Your fortress is a salty
waste of coral and clam.

Relinquish it at once!

Aah!

Submit,
you continental cunt.

Aah!
Got a better idea.

Oh, shit! Oh, shit!
Oh, shit! Oh, shit!

Aah!

Aah!

Happy?
Of course I'm happy.

You're acting like you won,

but this is exactly
what I wanted!

I am Mr. Nimbus!

Ugh, whatever.
Come on, Morty.

Man, that was intense.

Yeah nice work,
buddy.

Sorry I had to
blow up your bunker.

Not so fast, Sanchez.

It is I, Cookie Magneto.

What the fuck?

I'm -- I'm not engaging
this guy.

That's hardly
up to you, Rick.

I'm sorry, do you control things
that people agree are cookies?

Yes.
Okay, but cookies
aren't a substance.

They're more of a name
we -- we give to --

To the things I control.

Do you control cookie
ingredients?

Because, y'know,
t-that sounds dangerous.

Y'know,
everything has sugar in it.

Fight me and find --

Aah!

Jesus, Rick!
I'm sorry, Morty.

I know you're gonna say
it's punching down,

but I can't fight another
one of these '90s-style

goofball super villains.

I'm not
the fucking Tick.

I'm -- I'm exhausted.
Okay, but i-if you really

have a lot of these guys
gunning for you,

maybe you should look into
what you're doing to --

Oh, don't start that crap,
Morty.

I don't do anything for these
dipshits to seek me out.

I am Mr. Calypso!

Face me, you ugly, drunk,
ugly piece of shit.

Okay, I might look into it.

Why don't you have a seat?
'Cause this isn't
a therapy session.

I-I'm just asking you
what people in your racket

say about handling
this particular situation.

First, we'd want you
to define the situation.

I'm a walking target for a
never-ending sea of angry nerds

that think getting in a fight
with me is some kind of...

I don't know, platform?

I mean,
look at this guy.

He shows up and calls me
an "ugly drunk."

Because of course
that's the angle of attack

that's gonna undo me,
right?

You don't shoot Batman
in his fucking Batman logo.

And you think
locking this man in a chamber

and milking him of cosmic fluid
will somehow resolve this?

I think it's the best I can do
to profit from a situation

and maybe set an example.

But you've set this example
many times

and it's not changing
your situation.

Yeah, yeah, yeah, and now you're
gonna tell me to ignore them.

But guess what?
They want that too.

And why would they want
to be ignored?

You really believe if I let
a guy like this

do whatever he wants,
he gets bored and vanishes?

Rick, would you be interested
in proving me wrong?

Yes!
Then show me data.

Ignore them for a week
and see what happens.

You're on, bitch.

Is that man dead?

Is everything in here
confidential?

Everything but murder.

Then he's fine.

I mean, I-I think
it's pretty big, you know?

Big step
for the big cheese.

Yeah, Dad, I'm impressed.

Can we not
make it a big deal?

It's worth celebrating,
Rick.

You accepted the concept
of therapy

without turning yourself
into a pickle or a housefly.

Jerry, for fuck's sake,
that was a regular fly

in her office that day.

What the hell?
Riiick!

How 'bout a little piss?

Rick, why is there a man
shooting piss on our front lawn?

I'm sure he'll tell you.

I am Pissmaster!

Here to flush the toilet
that is Rick Sanchez.

He's spraying
my lavender bush.

My bees
need that lavender!

Remember five seconds ago

when you guys were stoked
about me changing

because it made
you feel superior?

Ooh,
whole family's here.

Who's that redhead?

Wouldn't mind spraying her
with a golden shower.

-Oh, my God, what?
-Hey!

Okay, that's it!

Jerry, please
think about this.

If you fight this guy,
I'm either an asshole

for not helping
or an asshole for helping.

My daughter just got
spoken of in porno terms,

and I'll respond
how I choose!

-Wait, Dad, don't!
-Honey!

Hey.

You want a piece of piss?

If that's your stupid rude way
of saying

I have to fight you,
I will.

Take your shot, pussy.

Don't talk to me that way.
Go away!

Make me.
Go away!

Ow!

Careful, honey!

Just stay down.

I --
I don't even know you.

Yeah, you don't know me.

But I'm gonna know your whole
ass, you son of a gun.

Hey, none of that!
Break it up, guys!

Hey! Come on!

Come on, you dirty
motherfucker.

No! No, no, no, no no!

Stop! Aah!

Uncle! Mercy! Mercy!

Stop! I give up!

Apologize to my daughter.

For what?

You know for what!

I'm sorry!

I'm sorry I sexualized you!

It came out wrong!

That's my dad.
That's my fucking dad!

Honey, I'm so proud of you.

Ow!

Oh, sorry.

Thank you, Rick.

Damn, hashtag
#FlamingoDad is everywhere!

Buzzfeed made
an odd numbered list

of other people's
observations about you,

and you're getting
a lot of hand clap emojis

on White Twitter's
impression of Black Twitter.

Jezebel's offering
a cash reward for evidence

that you're a bad person.

That is
their highest honor!

So this is what
it's like to trend.

Feels good.
Feels right.

Just keep in mind,
now a bunch more assholes

are gonna know they can get
a rise out of you.

Boooo!
Rick, let a dog
have one day.

I'm letting!
I'm letting!

Whoa.
Are those orbs?

This is
what I'm talking about.

Some asshole saw that fight
and, believe it not,

they were jealous
of Pissmaster.

I am
Blagnar the Eternal.

We seek the earthling
who beat up Pissmaster.

That's my dad,
Jerry Smith!

Jerry Smith.

Our Galactic Orbship
thirsts for justice

and those who deliver it.
Wait, what?

Our great council would like
to offer you this silver orb

and with it
a place amongst us.

Whoa.
It -- It -- It's sticky.

Yeah, that means
it's found a pure heart

it wants to bond with.

Y-You guys saw
my son-in-law on the news,

now he gets a sticky orb.

What's the catch?
We're not rubes.

Yeah, your power is well
known in our jurisdiction,

Rick Sanchez, and it should
come as no surprise

that our orbs
are unsticky for you.

Oh, no, first I get banned
from the Nextdoor app,

now this.

I'd be honored to join
your organization.

S-So what do I do?
Rub the orb when I see crime?

Or -- Or eat the orb
like spinach?

The orb is raw power.

Trust your heart,
Jerry.

It will know what to do.

Did you turn on the microwave?

No? Maybe?

I -- I was trying to fly.
I --

What?
I mean, come on, Rick.

Orbs and goblets,
this is your thing.

Orbs and goblets.

I'm just saying, you're
the orb guy in the family.

Can you please help me?

Jerry, I give you raw power,
you'll end up miserable like me.

Trust me, I'm helping
by not helping.

-Wow.
-Seriously, Rick?

What the eff, Grandpa?

Some creep tried to pee
on my tits and you did nothing.

Now you're gonna sit there
and hold our dad back

from being a hero?

Are you seriously
that petty?

Okay, you know what?
Fine!

Here.
Here's your goddamn suit.

I hard-wired the orb's
infinite energy right into it.

This shooty-thing looks cool.

That "shooty thing"
is a nuclear disruptor

that can blow up planets.
Whoa.

So tight.
Kinda hot.

Okay, show me, uh...

acts of evil happening
around the galaxy.

Whoa, Space Hitlers?

"Space Hitlers are convening
on Zeplar Prime."

My God, each one of them
is their own type of Hitler.

Yeah,
th-that's a problem.
Oh, shit, do that one.

Aw, you guys.
That's my parents.

Wow.

Well, family,

looks like Jerry Smith

has his first orb mission.

Lawn Flaming-Ho!

Just a reminder,
you guys asked for this.

Soon,
our legion of Hitlers

will bring
about a new galactic order.

A reich, if you will.

Riddle Hitler me this --

I'm sorry, are we just
letting in all Hitlers now?

Auf wiedersehen, bad guys!

Exterminate him!

Ow! Shit!
Oh, Jesus.

One at a time!

Ah, oh, my God!

Uh, hope there weren't
other people on that planet.

And there were no other people
on the planet!

Only Hitlers!

Each one ready to start
their own holocaust,

meaning an estimated
30 billion lives

were saved
by a single blast.

And the galaxy owes
it all to Jerry Smith.

Hashtag #FlamingoDad.

You gotta be
fucking kidding me.

Up next --
Oh, actually nothing.

I guess we're just gonna talk
about Jerry Smith some more.

I dunno, therapy is starting
to feel hopeless.

I've got so many issues!

Aah!

We need to talk.

Hey. No.

I will not speak with you
if you refuse to treat me

and my patients
with respect.

Oh, Lord.
I was a fly!

So unburdened,
so free of shame!

Welp,
I'm officially cured!

Here.
Here's your data.

Hard proof
that God hates me.

I ignored a troll,
and Jerry beat the guy's ass.

Now he's got this orb
and he's using the power

which I gave him to annihilate
planets of Hitlers,

and everyone's
popping champagne.

Rick, you came here because
you wanted things to change,

and they're changing.

It's working.

Oh, so if my bumbling
moron of a son-in-law

beats up people,
it's "working."

But if I do it,
it's a cosmic abuse of power?

Rick,
listen to yourself.

You're complaining about
how you have to be careful

with your immense power

and that Hitlers are dead.

Everything you're describing
is positive.

Oh, shit.
Not reacting.

That really
is the kill move?

I don't know if you need
to think about it

in terms of murder,
but, yes, just stay the course.

Okay, good -- good talk.

Well, what you're describing
is therapy,

and if you'd like
to keep receiving it,

start scheduling your visits
with Judy up front.

Thank you, thank you,
Flamingo Fam.

Uh, you know, when they asked me
if I wanted

to be the first human to drive
a Mitsubishi Space Lancer,

I thought, "Well, I don't know.

I got this cool orb suit
that goes really fast."

But you know what sold me?

The Council said I could pick
my own bridge crew.

Morty, Summer, Beth,
what do you say?

What?
Are you serious?

Oh, shit, yeah,
I love Mitsubishi!

Me too!
I-I've heard of them!
This is so exciting!

Oh, my God!
This is so cool!

Alright gang, orbs away!

O me o' my, can it be?

A giant piece of shit
I see?

I am Mr. Stringbean!

No one resists
my rhyming scheme!

Hey, douchebag,
why don't you chill out?

Who's this asshole?

I am Doctor Buckles!

Here to tighten the belt
on your opinions!

Oh, you wanna see
the Bean get mean?

Aah!

I'll be damned.
I'm out.

I'm out.

I'm -- I'm out.

Oh, my God, this Piss Guy
is getting wailed on.

Oh! Look at him, he tried
to crawl under the car!

What a loser.
Hey you watching
the Pissmaster video?

Yeah.
He has to be the biggest piece
of shit in the galaxy, right?

Oh-ho,
without a doubt.

Who could relate, being that
much of a piece of shit?

God damn it.

Fuck, shit, come on, man.

Fuck, come on, where is it?

Shit, shit.

Ugh!
Fuck!

Come on, Pissmaster, come on.

Aah!

Damn it.

It's me.

Please, please just open up.
Dad?

Mom told me you weren't
responding to her calls

and I'm worried, okay?

I know I said terrible things
about you on my podcast.

It's just...I've been
so frustrated with you.

Look, if you
were to ever do something,

I'd never stop blaming myself.

Just, please.
Please let me know you're okay.

God damn it.

I'm okay, honey.
We're good.

I thought something
happened to you.

I can tell you for sure --
if anything happens to me,

it's 100% not on you.

It's my own choice.

You still sound like
you're gonna do something bad.

Just promise you won't,
okay?

Okay, yeah.

Promise.

Love you, Dad.

Fuck.

Well, this is it.

I'm killing myself
because of Jerry Smith.

The Earth man.
FlamingoDad.

Seeing them all cheer
as I got my ass whipped

made me realize --
people just wanna see me fail.

All I've ever wanted to do
is prove them wrong.

Help!

Wait! Who are you?

Pissmaster.

M-Make, make sure you tell
everybody Pissmaster saved you.

Those were heat-seeking pissiles
by the way.

Not just missiles.

Oh, ugh, okay.

Y'all ready for piss?

Yo! Pissmaster!

You saving that cat to make
people forget you suck?

Nope, just saving it
to save it.

Okay, we got nothing.

Piss

Pee

Urine

Number one

Pee pee

Piss

-Pee
-Look, it's Pissmaster!

Dr. Wong, what's up?

Rick, you're late
for your session.

Cancel it. Bill me.
I'm good.
You're good?

Yeah, see, I put on
the suit of my enemy

and I fucking love it.

Now I'm gonna make a giant
bomb, plant it in a city,

and then have his suit
auto-pilot the bomb into space.

Boom. Everyone will think
Pissmaster sacrificed himself.

He dies a hero,
I get a win I'd otherwise

never get myself,
nice wet bow on top.

I'm tempted to
second guess a lot of that,

but I think
you might be nailing it.

What?
If it's free and fun,
do it.

It sounds healthy.

Oh, that wasn't my goal,

but good to know.

Shit, gotta go.

No, exactly.
And the slave planet thing,

I hear he broke their chains
with pure urine, so...

Hey, guys, sorry I'm late,
lot of traffic on the orbway.

Take a seat, Jerry.

We were just discussing
Pissmaster's honorable rise.

I mean, who cares, right?

Uh, people are talking
about him.

He's becoming likable.

Good, even.

But...
he's Pissmaster.

People change,
Jerry.

Everyone loves
a comeback story.

All in favor of

offering orbship
to Eugene Michael Piss,

aka Pissmaster?

Orb-yes.

All those opposed?

Obviously orb-no.

The orbship has spoken.

You know what, Jerry? I think
this is a good test for you.

If you can't let go of your
pettiness enough

to recruit Pissmaster, maybe you
don't deserve your orb.

And, Jerry...

don't come back without him.

Absolute chaos!

No one knows who planted
the bomb,

but one thing is clear:

Orphan Island, a city
populated entirely by orphans,

now sits on the brink of doom.

The Orphan Island bomb squad
is trying to dismantle

it as we speak.

I can't stress enough,
I'm eight years old,

I have no idea
what I'm doing!

Look!
It's Pissmaster!

Oh, no! There's no time
to dismantle it!

Come on, it's not safe here.

Whoa, oh, oh!
Whoo-hoo!

Pisspop? Pisspop?
Pisspop?

Pissmaster.
Jerry,
what are you doing here?

Eugene Michael Piss,

by decree of
the Andromeda strain,

our great council presents
you with this orb,

which you have to take.

Fuck off, Jerry, I'm in
the middle of something.
Excuse me?

Hey, this is the greatest honor
you could ever be given.

I don't want it!
Well, you have to take it.

Jesus Christ,
get the fuck out of here!

He's flying it into space!

He's gonna sacrifice himself!

Get back here,
you ungrateful shit!

What is your problem?! You're
screwing up my hero death!
Good!

FlamingoDad
wants us to blow up?!

When did he become a shitheel?

Life comes at you fast.

Jesus, Dad!
People are filming!

Yeah, maybe dial it back?

Rick?

PissSuit!
Auto-pilot the payload!

Confirmed.

That's my
fucking dad.

Jerry?!
Dad?! Are you okay?

Your father is
the fucking Pissmaster!

Um...
Grandpa?
What the hell?

Jerry, what is this?

People are saying
you turned shitheel?

Well, apparently my
father-in-law is Pissmaster,

so why don't
you ask him?

What the...?
Rick Sanchez the Pissmaster?

Okay,
this is not a good look.

This family, man.

Look, I don't know
what kinda weird shit

you two are pulling, but
it's completely unstickworthy.

We're done here.
But I didn't know!

I-I'm a good guy,.
I -- I made you all famous!

I'm 1,000 years old.

You know how many
"Flamingo Dads" I've seen?

Don't orb us.

I don't get it.

You -- You were
Pissmaster the whole time?

Obviously not, Jerry.

I put the suit on once
Pissmaster kill--

Uh, when --
when you made him...

Uh, yeah.
I-I've always been Pissmaster.

But that would mean you let
my dad beat you up

just so he could,
like, feel more confident?

Wow.
Damn, Rick.

Yeah, that's amazing.
Hold on, Wh--

Everyone's
just accepting this?

Wait.
Wasn't Pissmaster an alien?

He obviously
avatar'd it.
Probably a robot.

But why? Why would Rick even
prop me up like that?

Jesus, Jerry. Rick did
something nice for once, okay?

He's obviously
trying to change.

You are no
longer worthy of Mitsubishi.

Proud of you, Dad.

Or should I say: Pissmaster.

Yeah, Grandpa, sorry
I yelled at you.

And I guess I'm sorry
for trying to stop you

from killing yourself
with a nuclear bomb.

I just...
really liked having an orb.

Eh.
Don't sweat it, Jer.

Piss under the bridge.

Man, I guess
the therapy worked, huh?

Opening up, doing all that
just to make my dad feel good.

That's pretty great
of you, Rick.

Yeah...
that's right, Morty.

That's right.
Wait, Morty.

You have to promise
not to tell anyone,

but your dad made Pissmaster
kill himself.

Oh, man, what?!
Yeah, I mean,

I found him dead
and I -- I put on his suit,

but look at this --
he literally blames your dad.

Holy shit.
Wait, you kept the suicide note?

That's so messed up!
I know, I mean,
I had to tell someone, Morty.

I couldn't just
sit on that.
And you expect me to?

Morty, no!
What are you doing?!

Aah! What the hell?!
He killed himself?

Jesus, Dad,
you should've told us!

Especially
if Jerry murdered him!

Wait, don't say that, I --
I didn't murder!

Hey, I -- I thought
it was pretty cool

that I withheld
that information.
But you didn't withhold it!

You're walking around
with the note!
Yeah, Grandpa,

you gotta, like, keep it in your
heart as a great sacrifice.

That's the cool move.
I mean,
how am I the bad guy?

He sprayed piss on us!
You -- You all cheered me on!
Don't drag us into this.

A man is dead, Dad.
Again,
wasn't gonna say it,

but I told you
this would happen.

Get off your high horse.
Boooo!

Dr. Wong would be so proud.
Go ahead and boo.

I was breathing piss,
you think I care?

Is this
what it's like to trend?

This is a nightmare!

I should've just let him
pee on my daughter!

Ew!
What the hell, Dad?

How about Jack Miller,
aka CarJack?

He lifted a car
off a stranger.

-Eh.
-I guess.

-Next.
-Orb-no.

We're fresh off a dad
and a piss guy.

Maybe we add someone
that's already powerful?

We have to be realistic
about who we can get.

I have a pitch.
We're not gonna add
Scarlett Johansson.

Next up: Mr. Nimbus,
lord of the oceans.

Oh, I hear he controls
the police.

-Wow.
-The police?

-Orb-yes.
-Ohhh.

Guys, I already checked.

His reps say
he's really busy right now.

-He just doesn't wanna do it.
-Everyone says that.

Oh, and we're not busy?

Did you get any of that?

﻿Ugh, guess this is
how it ends.

I thought I was
better than this.

Dramatic voiceover
while stranded in space?

I-I guess when you're dying,

the first thing to go
is your creativity.

Citadel's gone...

and -- and the saucer we
escaped in is out of power...

Aw, man,
I'm so scared in here.

The extra Mortys went feral.

Eh, some problems
solve themselves.

Been drinking a lot.

Morty!
I told you to write this down!

I-I don't have a helmet
like that Avengers guy did.

Been drinking a lot of
my piss.

Portal gun's still broken.

Guess that was all part of
Evil Morty's plan.

"Evil Morty."
Can we stop flattering this guy?

His "plan"
was to monologue and fuck off.

He basically
threw a tantrum

to announce he was
quitting Twitter.

Nobody quits Twitter.

Hey, remember
like a second ago

when you pretended not to know
who Iron Man was?

Who was that for?
Shh, shh, shush, Morty.

This is how we go.
Bear it with grace.

Spinal cord -- Robitussin
as a base, then surprise me.

Mom!
Beth maybe!

Is she trying to
say something?

We -- We can't hear you!

How dumb are --
Beth, you're in a vacuum!

Sound travels on air!

Why am I yelling?

Wow, great.
Yeah, that's --

Wow, really worth it.

That was not worth it!

It's corny.

You. Corn.

Dying of starvation here!

Oh, my God.
Stop explaining.

Stop explaining!
Are you finished?

She's not finished.

Oh, real mature,
r-real classy.
Oh, nice.

It was a good line, honey.

I didn't need it to be.
I don't care what you think.

Oh, my God, she found you.
Here, eat, eat, eat.

Oh, hell yes!
Hold on, buddy,

our systems could go into shock
from solid food.

Digestibot,
convert to nutrient mass.

I'm just gonna risk it.
Mmm.

Since when you do you guys
get stranded?

Thank you, by the way.

Almost left them out there.

Portal travel's broken.

Mmm, are these
heirloom tomatoes?

Digestibot, try these.

Yum. Yum.
So you can't hop realities
anymore.

Does that mean you'll finally
have to wash your robe?

Good point, I need to reboot
the portal index immediately.

Basically just a hard reset
on the fluid.

Hold tight,
the Earth's gonna shake a bit.

Um...

Oh!
Ohh, shit.

Wait, what?
W-What's happening?

Instead of resetting
portal travel,

I may have reset
portal travelers.

Too late to apologize.

Rick,
why am I pulsing green?

And don't say you don't know
because you're pulsing green.

Rick,
are we about to die?

No, we're about to vanish
from this reality.

That's totally dying!
No, it isn't.

It's everyone from this reality
returning to

their reality of origin.

Back to our
original universes?

I explained it fine, Morty.
You're spoonfeeding spoons!

W-Where's Summer?
Oh, nice,
you guys are back.

Whoa.
Summer, three of us
are one-way blind hopping.

You gotta help us get back.
There's a protocol for this

in your chore server,
filename Booger AIDs.

Every file
is Booger AIDS!

I-I hate naming things!
Just search for words like

"one way blind hop
reset nav beacon."

Why do I have
a "reality of origin?"

There's no time to explain,
Jerry!

Counting on you, Summer!
One way blind hop

beacon protocol!

Here we gooooo!

So there was time
to explain.

Don't waste
extra precious seconds

with your pettiness,
Jerry!

Summer, let's run down - -
One way blind hop

reset beacon
booger AIDS.

Cool.

Wow.
There was so much time
to explain!

Yes! Fine,
hindsight is 20-20!

Who has ever taken
this long to vanish?

How did I end up
not in my own universe?!

Oh, my God.
The Jerryboree!

Ohhhhhhhh, the Jerryboree.
Ohhhhhhhh, the Jerryboree.

Deep cut.

Wait, but where's our real Dad
and our real Morty?

Buried in the backyard!

That's what the possums
are after.

Dad's got you in the family
business too, huh?

Yeah, Morty's an easy mark, but
Rick pays me in things like...

Wolverine claws.

Whelp,
looks like you got this.

See you guys in another
two years?

Or you could stick around
for this one?

Looks like it involves
Grandpa's grody citadel.

We could, you know,
break things, loot stuff.

Should probably
get back to...

saving the galaxy.

Please!

Uh...
Guess I could loot some stuff.

Fine, yeah, okay,
let's make it quick.

Awesome, I've never been.
Let's do this.

Okay, adventure family!
Whoo!

Uh, okay.

Fuck.

Excuse me?
Bro, Ricks don't pass on this.

Rick? Is that you?

Yeah...Diane.

You've been gone so long.

Did you find
our daughter's killer?

Not yet, sorry.
Still looking.

You'll find him.
You always do everything

you set your mind to.

Except keep your family
alive.

But that was hardly
your fault!

Mute.

If I could be muted,
I wouldn't be

too-too-too good at haunting

you, would I,
you dirty bear?

Yeah, forgot I wanted to
be haunted.

I guess you predicted
you might.

That's where haunting
comes in handy, huh?

Very good point, sugar.

Rick?

Hello? Original family?

Sorry about last time.

Rick, he was in space prison.

W-We couldn't just --
hello?

Aw, geez.

Ahh.

Ah, fuck.

Damn it, Morty,
there's no doctors anymore.

Dad?

Figures it's underwhelming
the one time I visit.

Yeah, sorry,
usually there's cowboy

Rick and Mortys
and stuff.

Oh, looks like
they could use a couple

repairman Rick and Mortys,
right?

Oh, tight,
little scavenger dudes!

If they shoot at us
I'm allowed to --

...do this.

Shit, yeah!

Space Mom,
get in on this!

Cool Mom!

Let's keep it moving.
I don't have all day.

I got it!

I got it!
I got it!

Sorry!

Sorry!

I got it. Sorry!

I was gonna do it.

Ugh.
Terrestrials, am I right?

I kept up the search
in your absence.

You want a new list of
potential locations?

You're always just
one room away, huh?

Yeah, uh, remember?

You thought if you could see
or touch me,

it might give you a level of
com-com-comfort.

Right. Can't have that.

Come on, Summer.

Who's Summer?
Should I be jealous?

I hope Summer knows what happens
to the people you love!

Hey, Rick!

Hey,
Mr. Goldmanbachmajorian.

S-Still alive, huh?
W-What's up?

I was wondering if you could
help me make sense of

a note I found
this morning?

It's written by someone
claiming to be me.

They say my mind is held captive
in a time loop,

trapped in the day of
a traumatic event

by the agony of
a formidable intelligence.

But also that my captor
forgot about aging --

that my body spoils and yearns
for death

while my soul remains
stuck in place,

caught like a fly in amber.

Right.
I used to drink drink.

Uh, no clue, pal.
That's okay.

I found other notes in the trash
just like it.

Poor weirdo.
I pity them.

Wish they could let go
and move on.

Sounds healthy.
Sure would be!

Ohhhhhh!

Sweet death.

Was that symbolic?

Are you letting go?

I understand, baby.
I forgive you --

You don't get to say that!
You're not her.

You're a thing I built to
torture myself.

This whole fucking
timeline is cursed.

I gotta get out of here.

Because you want to
move on.

Because I don't.

And I have to.

I came back on accident.

Guy I'm looking for,
he's...

he's not findable, Diane.

I live with
a version of Beth, now.

Sounds like
a version of nice.

We have grandkids.

Tha--
That's who Summer is.

She's gonna get me
out of here.

She reminds me of you.

Oh, really?
Is she dead too?

Bye, Diane.

You're not honestly
gonna fly into

that rift without coordinates,
are you?

Don't give up on us,
Rick!

I don't make the rules!

Haunters gonna haunt!

Baby?
Are you killing yourself?

I'm more embracing the "win-win"
of risking my life.

Where's Mom and Summer?

Oh, they're gone.

Sorry, Morty.
Gone gone?

We spent a long time
in that ice.

A gentle mutant licked us out,
but Beth got sick, and Summer...

didn't thaw right.

With no one left to blame, I
finally had to deal with myself.

Buried my grief
at Barnes & Noble.

"Four Agreements,"
"Eat Pray Love,"

Frank Miller's
"The Dark Knight Returns."

Learned to accept things
for what they are.

In a few of these,
the whole brain is still intact.

Makes you wonder if some people
were still in there,

just trapped in the horror.

Anyway,
it's awesome protein.

I'm so sorry, Dad.

But my real, original Dad
beat the apocalypse.

I-I-I guess we all
underestimated you.

Hey, w-what's that game
we always used to

try to play as a family, y--
the one we never finished?

Downbeat.
Yes! Let's play Downbeat.

I-I bet I can find it!
We can finish now.

Yeah, you should totally
do that.

Hey, yeah, cool,
I-I got it!

We'll play Downbeat
and we'll -- we'll camp here

tonight and then
rebuild the house.

You know,
we got food, fresh water,

and we've got family.

The fuck?

Morty.
I wrote this note in advance

in case you're wondering
how I left so fast.

My plan is to wait for you
to turn your back,

then I'm going to grab
all your shit and split.

Depending on how long
you were out of the room,

you'll probably be thinking
I can't be that far away

and you'll want to foll--

Morty, wrote this fast
'cause had to set trap.

Thought you'd have cooler shit.
See other note, bye.

Motherfu--

Whoa-whoa!
Slow down! Slow down!

Not cool! Oh!

What the hell, Dad?

Don't take it personal,
Morty.

That's one of
the Four Agreements.

I don't remember the other
three, but I know

Commissioner Gordon was cool
with Batman moving on.

Batman doesn't abandon
people!

You abandoned us.

I deserve that.
But, you know, it...

it improved you.

Oh, am I cool enough
for you now?

Well, that was easy.

It only cost me
fucking everything.

Whoa, hey, I-I --
You came back and talked

about us like we weren't
people, Morty!

Then you bailed
and left us to freeze!

I-I was apologizing
for that earlier --

Your mom and sister died,
Morty!

And I moved on.

From caring.

And that is the best deal
you will ever get.

So take it.
Please don't go.

I-If Rick comes back, we ca--
we can find you a new reality,

a new Mom, new Summer,
a...job!

Oh, you don't get it,
kid.

Except for this conversation,
my life is perfect.

Rick was always right.
Everyone needs to let go.

Aww, you came back.

I guess we really did
form a bond.

Ow! Hey, stop it!

Get away from me!
No, help!

Alright, pin dropped,
Grandpa!

Come and get us.

Come on, come on, come on!

Baby?
Something to keep in mind --

If you were pulled home
by whatever happened,

it's likely our target was,
as well.

It's also likely he's having as
much trouble leaving as you are.

He's trapped.

Grandpa!

Oh, fuck yes!

Grandp--
...andpa?

Summer! Gold star,
always believed in you.

N-Now the hard part.
Hard part?

Way worse things than me
can see that beacon, too.

Hunker down and protect it
while I grab Morty.

Rick out!
Try to survive!

Oh, shit.

Domestic Mom
should hide maybe?

"Domestic Mom"?

I mean,
she's the cool space one.

Look, I'm not looking to
get caught in whatever this is.

You guys can both hide maybe,
hash it out.

Oh, quit talking down!

I'm you with the patience
to do laundry.

Mom, stop being jealous
of our bond!

She ran from our choices.
I have to parent them.

It's not like I didn't care.
That's what the clone was for.

Aah!

Moms!

Morty!

Rick?
I knew it!

I knew you wouldn't
leave me!

Ow! The fuck?

Morty, did you see
another Rick here?

Nondescript haircut,
sci-fi jacket?

Eh, of course you didn't
see him, you'd be dead.

Or you'd be a bomb.

Do you feel bomby?

Nah, you woulda
blown up by now.

Wasn't the Rick here dead?

Th-That's why
you pick places, right?

Uh, well, your Rick, uh,

yeah, not dead,
more like not around.

When I met you, I was sorta
hoping he might turn up one day.

You son of a bitch!
I got you!

W-W-Where are we going?

To kill your grandpa,
little buddy.

Wait, what?

I don't understand.

My original Rick
killed your family?

And you were just
waiting for him to come back?

Seems like you understand fine,
Morty.

That was A+ re-piping.

We're here.

This guy, Morty,
he hates being found

but loves building
elaborate shit.

Like -- Like -- Like
playing a ton of "Minecraft"

but all on
a private server.

Am I in a fucking
K-hole right now?

What is going on?

Whoa, hoho, you found me!

I shoot the first monitor,
too.

Listen, I'm not here.

Or am I?

There's the clone
you found.

Or maybe it's me,
all naked!

Just a lil Keyser Soze.

I mean,
why would I admit it's not?

Oh-hoho, yeah!
Look at him!

Look at him go,
look at him dance.

O-Or me.
Again, it might be me,

like a "Saw" thing.
I'm very sneaky.

Here's a bunch of killbots
to deal with

while ya
wrestle with that.

Obviously, I don't know
who I'm talking to here.

It's all prerecorded.

But if you got this far,

you probably think
you're real special.

Tell you what...

Oop! There he goes!

Maybe that actually was me!

If you follow him down there,

we can do a big fight.

50% chance I'm not lying.

We're in trouble, asshole!

I shouldn't have to beg.

Wait, my moms
are in trouble?

Those versions
of them are.

W-We gotta save them!
Rick, this is an obvious trap.

If you go down there
he's just gonna kill you.

Good!
What?

Now what?!

If you don't care if you die,
why do you care if I die?

Knock it off!
Get out of here!

You did this last season!
You're like a suicide bomber!

Takes one to know one.

Yeah, well,
you get it from him, not me.

I don't know him.
You're my grandpa, Rick.

Rick and Morty.
A hundred years.

This place totally might
go up, by the way.

Here's a bunch of
countdowns.

One of them's
probably accurate.

Ah, fucking stupid
5th-dimensional stomach juices.

Sorry for the sitcom fight,

and maybe getting us
digested.

You've got
incredible timing.

Oh, don't be a bitch.
I'm parenting.

Makes sense
you don't recognize it.

You've been out of practice
for a while.

Good!
I'm glad that they have you!

I don't want to be
"Space Mom."

You've made that clear.

Just don't let
Summer mistake

your rejection of her
for good taste.

I'm not trying to.
It's all her!

Jesus! It'd be cool
if you were around more.

I don't wanna get married.

I'm 17.
My affection is the wind.

Don't try to compete
for it.

I could hear every word of that
through the helmets.

Thank fuck
I only had to kill most of them.

Jesus,
that ship really has sailed.

And now we feast!

This emergency
was oversold to me.

-Grandpa!
-Morty!

Moms! Wait,
i-if they had to

wear helmets --
I do childproofing stuff
while you're asleep.

Why don't you
childproof Dad?

Ah, great reminder.
Wait!

Time to get Jerry.
Ugh.

Maybe I wouldn't be
so uptight

If I wasn't married to
an unemployed

receptacle of human fear!

Get a job, Dad,
it's been a decade.

Woof.
Pretty brutal, Jer.

I-I know a good
alligator park

if you wanna kill yourself.

I got expelled today.

-What the hell, Morty?!
-Oh, no, you got expelled.

-Whoa, what a horrible thing.
-You are so fucking dumb!

-Too bad, Morty.
-Hi, hon.

Woof, some real
Season 2 vibes

in there,
you know what I'm sayin?

You know,
never thought I'd say this,

but I think I'm glad we spent
that time divorced.

Er, one second.
I'll build a fucking
swing set in the backyard!

You know,
I may technically be from here.

But I'm a goddamn
interdimensional traveler now.

And all of you
can kiss my sci-fi ass.

It gets me every time.

Wow, what an amazing joke
I just told.

A-And also,
what an adventure.

You know, I guess it doesn't
matter where we're from

if we're together, huh?

Good --
Good final moral thing.

This is everyone's
"original dimension" now.

Great wrap-ups, kids.

-Ugh, you're back.
-Oh, shit, Season 2 Jerry!

Look,
before you bust my balls,

can someone help
with the shower?

It's colder than Beth
on our anniversary.

Also, look who I found
in Rick's room.

Mmmm, I'm Mr. Frundles!

I don't care
how cute he is.

We agreed
no boogens in the house.

Wait,
Season 2 Jerry, don't!

- Whoa!
- Mr. Frundles!

Everybody in the car.

Mmmm, I'm Mr. Frundles!

Wait, but I thought
he was Mr. Frundles.

Everybody in the car!
Now!

Nyah!
Mmmm, I'm Mr. Frundles!

What the fuck, Dad?!

Why would you bring that thing
into our house?

It was cute!
Fuck.

We gotta find
a new timeline now!

You know how hard that shit is
without portals?

We gotta do the thing with
the Rift and the beacon again!

The whole fucking
episode all over again!

Car,
fabricate some vomit bags.

Can't we just go back
and fix it?

Mmmm, I'm Mr. Frundles!

I can't believe
portal travel's broken.

I'll get to it
when I get to it.

Lift with your knees,
Mom.

How many times
have you done this?

Oh, God.

And you swear they die of
natural causes?

Mm-hmm, yep.

The exact same as
our old timeline?

Even my stuff?
Bit of a rush job, actually,

so they do say
"parmesan" weird.

How do they say --
Par-mees-ian.

-Boo.
-Jesus Christ.

I could've left you guys!
You think the concept of

"family" matters to me?
I'm not even your Rick!

-Uh-huh.
-"I'm Denial Rick!"

See you inside, Dad.

Sorry I was such a Dance Mom
about Summer.

She's your daughter, too.

No, boundaries are good.

But, uh, speaking of,
maybe I've put up too many.

Is it okay if I come around
sometimes?

That could be nice.

That's a cute outfit.
The one we always wear?

Yes, Morty?

You promise I'm not,
you know, bait?

T-To make that Rick
come back?
What?

M-Morty, for you to be bait,
the guy'd have to

value something.
He truly does not give a shit.

He's the real deal.

Parmeee-san.
Par-meees-ian.

Par-mees-ian.

Par-- Parmeeeeeesian.
Parmesian.

Gross. I hate it.
Yeah.

Hello? Morty?

That one big rat?

Whoa,
this is a development.
Gah!

Shh.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,

lil guy, easy.
You're a Jerry, right?

Never got too close to
the concept.

Boy, you have really
arc'd out.

Were you putting on pants?

What?
Oh, yeah, no, I was naked

to fuck with a guy.
Speaking of, did you talk to me,

or a little kid around here?

Maybe. Why?

Because if you hate them,
too...

I could be down for
a little team up.

Eh, I really don't "team up"
anymore.

Managing people,
such a headache.

Aah!

Fatality...

Jerry wins.

Oh, goddamn dude.

Badass!

Why are you here?

Buddy, I have been asking myself
that exact same question.

Did you get any of that?
